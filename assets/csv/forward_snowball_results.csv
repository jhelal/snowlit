The effects of the three main variable components of UHPC, ultra-fine fly ash (UFFA), metakaolin (MK), and steel fibre content, were investigated to understand the behaviour of sustainable UHPC. Twenty UHPC mixtures were designed and generated experimentally using the central composite design concept in RSM. Workability, density, compressive, and splitting tensile strengths were the most important performance requirements and responses of these UHPC mixtures. The predicted models showed that all inputs and outputs are perfectly correlated. Moreover, a multi-objective optimization technique shows that the properties of hardened UHPC improved as the content of UFFA and steel fibres increased. As a result, a sustainable UHPC with a compressive strength of 164.10 MPa, a splitting strength of 16.1 MPa, and a slump value of 139 mm was produced using 675.43 kg/m3 of cement content, 135 kg/m3 of silica fume, 236 kg/m3 of steel fiber, and the optimum content of industrial wastes (UFFA = 163.74 kg/m3). To investigate the microstructure and composition of the hydration products, optimally proportioned and control mix samples were examined by SEM and XRD. Macroscopic results revealed that the UHPC with optimal UFFA content has a denser microstructure, which confirms the effectiveness of RSM in determining the optimal mix parameters of the UHPC design. The results of economic and environmental evaluations demonstrate that the incorporation of UFFA and MK significantly reduces the cost and carbon emissions of UHPC, and the effect of UFFA is even more significant.",,0,0,,,,,

All the tested beams were constructed from the same UHPFRC mix containing steel fibers volume fraction of 1.5 %. The test program included eight simply supported deep beams with the same cross-section and same longitudinal reinforcement. The principal studied parameters were opening height, width, location, and the stirrups ratio œÅv %. The provided stirrups spacing sv was considerably more than the maximum stirrups spacing sv,max required by ACI 318 code for normal reinforced concrete, while sv,max required by the Egyptian code (ECP 203) were more or equal to sv. The equations used by French recommendations (AFGC) and Korea Concrete Institute (KCI) for the shear design of UHPFRC deep beams have been examined. The experimental results indicated that the shear capacity of UHPFRC deep beams is mainly controlled by opening height, width, and location. Square opening with a height of 20 % of the beam's overall height located at the natural load pass caused reduction of shear capacity by 43 % compared with the reference solid beam. Increasing the opening width by 75 % symmetrically around the natural load pass reduced the shear capacity of the UHPFRC beam by about 21 % while increasing the opening width by 125 % from one side out of the load pass caused a reduction by only 5 %. Increasing the stirrups ratio by 80 % for beams of similar opening size and location, increased the shear capacity by 17.1 %. Predicting the ultimate shear strength of the tested UHPFRC deep beams with openings of height 20 % and 40 % of the beam's total height using the equations of AFGC was just safe if these equations were calculated by deducting the height of opening from the beam effective depth.

Four lightweight concrete mixes were prepared and tested for the preliminary mechanical properties and pullout feature. In addition to the reference mix, the other three mixes incorporated micro, hook end and hybrid steel fibres at 1.5% by volume of the concrete mix. To evaluate the bond strength aspect, block specimens were reinforced with deformed steel bars of two diameters (12 or 25 mm). A comparison has been made with some relevant empirical formulas and codes of practice. The results obtained revealed superior performance for the fibrous lightweight concrete mixes in terms of the mechanical properties. The highest improvement in the compressive, tensile and pullout strengths reached 28, 163 and 225%, respectively. For the preliminary mechanical tests (i.e., compressive, tensile strengths), hybrid lightweight concrete mix showed the highest values, while hook end lightweight concrete mix seem to be the optimal for the case of pullout feature. Regardless of the geometry, the steel fibres increase the interior bond and prevent the propagation of cracks throughout tailoring mechanism.

It was observed that the inclusion of RA makes significant changes in the microscopic, physical, and mechanical properties of concrete. Incorporating RA in the concrete leads to increased voids, which can be easily detected with microscopic images through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Workability and density of the concrete mixes were decreased up to 14.85% and 4.76%, respectively, and an increment of 2.8% was observed in air content at a 15% MS substitution level.

In the present study mortars were prepared in which we substituted CDA for OPC by various proportions, and measured their strengths after 7 and 28 days of curing. After 7 days, the strongest mortar among the formulations tested was that with 10% CDA substitution (11.12 MPa, vs. 10.98 MPa control); after 28 days, that with 20% CDA substitution was strongest (27.58 MPa, vs. 22.85 control).

To improve the structural mechanical state and reduce the risk of shrinkage cracks, the non-shrinkage concrete and the clustered shearing connector pocket are used in engineering applications, but the existing empirical model can hardly describe the physicochemical process in the actual structure. Focusing onresponsestiphysics mechanism of concrete shrinkage and the contribution of expansion additive, a comprehensive model is proposed for non-shrinkage concrete in this paper, and the processes of the hydration reaction, the humidity transport, and the mechanical response are included. The free shrinkage test regresses the parameter of material shrinkage, and the corresponding structural test verifies the multiphysics model of the clustered shearing connector pocket. With the volume increasing along the hydration reaction of expansion additives, the ‚àí120 ŒºŒµ shrinkage of normal concrete is compensated to the 160 ŒºŒµ expansion. In the clustered shearing connector pocket, the slight expansion of non-shrinkage concrete can keep the structural compression state and eliminate the risk of local cracks. According to structural test, the early age behavior is constrained by the prefabricated deck, reinforcement and clustered studs greatly, and the expansion strains at the pocket upper and bottom are reduced by about 16% and 72%, respectively. In the multiphysics simulation, not only the time-dependent shrinkage strains at different positions are predicted accurately, but also the detailed distributions of hydration ratio, relative humidity and mechanical stress are also presented.
