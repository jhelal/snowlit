The study presented a dynamic LCA model to predict life cycle carbon emissions of the buildings and optimize the insulation parameter with the improved temporal validation of upstream parameters. A case passive building was selected to perform the dynamic method based on the basic and operational information of this building. The key temporal parameters were collected and predicted via grey prediction. And the electric mix structure was predicted via scenario analysis method. The dynamic life cycle carbon emissions of energy systems were evaluated in different scenarios by the combination of predicting results and historical data.

This study aims to assess the potential environmental advantages and disadvantages of newly developed construction and demolition waste (CDW)-based geopolymer materials for 3D printing of built-environment structures. The study identifies potential “hot spots” of the developed process where environmental impact is highest and develops strategies to reduce or mitigate negative impacts. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried out for three cases of CDW-based 3D printed structures, Portland cement-based 3D printed structures, and conventional masonry construction methods and materials, to analyze the environmental impact of CDW-based 3D-printed designs and their comparative analysis. The results showed that geopolymer-based 3D printed construction resulted in the lowest global warming potential of 488 [kg CO2 eq] as compared to 595.6 [kg CO2 eq] for ordinary Portland cement-based structure and 533.7 [kg CO2 eq] for conventional masonry construction of the equivalent structure. The main environmental “hot spot” identified for the geopolymer-based 3D printed construction process was the amount of electrical energy required for the mechanical processing of waste materials, which was more than 61% of the total GWP impact.

This study develops a method that integrates building energy modelling (BEM) and life cycle assessment (LCA) tools, IES Virtual Environment (IES VE) and One Click LCA, to conduct a life cycle assessment of the operational and embodied carbon impacts of a typical terraced building shell in an eco self-build community housing (ESBC) project, using Water Lilies as a case study. It evaluates and compares the 60-year life cycle carbon impacts of six design options that apply different insulation materials to the case study building shell. The results are based on grid-connected Future Energy Scenarios (FES) that have different carbon intensities predicted over time and the microgrid-connected Water Lilies Community Energy (WLCE) scenario that is operationally net-zero carbon. Depending on the FES, embodied carbon accounted between 59 and 80% of total emissions compared to 20–41% from operational carbon across design options. The results show that operational carbon is highly sensitive to the percentage of renewables in the energy mix of the grid, which is difficult to predict, and can significantly influence the design choice. As such, future researchers should account for predicted changes to the carbon intensity of the grid by applying a similar method to that proposed. Overall, the integration of IES VE and One Click LCA provided a more streamlined life cycle assessment to help inform early design decisions by enabling energy consumption simulation in BEM to assess operational carbon emissions and the automated transfer of building materials from the BEM model to the LCA tool to assess embodied carbon emissions. The limitations included the unavailability of material-specific data in early design stage plans, the inability to automatically transfer the timber frame structure from IES VE to One Click LCA, and the uncertainty of future energy trends.",Building energy modelling | Eco-housing | Life cycle assessment | Sustainable construction,0,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,EPSRC,EP/R513179/1,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council

The industrial wastes used in this study include silica fume (SF), granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS), and fly ash (FA). The prepared mixtures were created by varying the amounts of Portland cement, GGBS (30–50%), FA (20–30%), or MK (15–25%), while maintaining a constant amount of SF of 15%. The mechanical, durability, and micro-structural characteristics of the mixtures were investigated. This study also uses life cycle assessment to estimate the reductions in embodied energy consumption, life cycle cost, and carbon footprint associated with integrating metakaolin and industrial waste. The results indicated that the inclusion of 15%MK led to an increase in the compressive, flexural, and splitting tensile strengths. Also, the chloride permeability resistance was enhanced. The mechanical properties and chloride-ion permeability resistance of the ternary mixtures with 50%GGBS and 25%MK were the lowest compared to other mixtures. These results were supported by SEM micrographs and EDX analysis for the UHPC structure, which demonstrate the high-density microstructure and extremely thin interfacial transition zone thickness. The inclusion of industrial waste and metakaolin can lower environmental impact of UHPC without compromising the mechanical performance. Also, the environmental assessment shows that the UHPC containing industrial waste has a lower impact on the environment, which means they could make cleaner products in the near future.",CO  emission 2 | Durability | Life cycle cost | Mechanical properties | Ternary mixtures | UHPC,9,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,IFP-2022-X,

Large-span steel structures usually consume more materials, need more complex construction processes, and thus have a larger environmental impact. This study presents a comparative analysis of the life cycle carbon emissions of three typical large-span steel structures, i.e., a cable dome, a reticulated shell, and a suspendome, based on a design case. A tiered hybrid method using the process-based life cycle assessment for the processes with emission factors and using input–output-based life cycle assessment for the processes without emission factors is proposed to assess the life cycle carbon emissions. Comparisons on the carbon emissions of the three structures reveal that the cable dome is the best of the three, having the lowest steel consumption and the lowest carbon emissions. Although the component production phase appears to contribute most of the total emissions, the construction phase is also of considerable importance in alleviating the present emission pressure, especially for the cable dome and suspendome. Further analysis shows that carbon emissions of large-span steel structures are not simply linearly related to steel consumption and need to be considered as a separate design objective.

However, little has been said about the consequences of such shifts and decisions in terms of building architecture and structural design, especially in seismic-prone regions. In this study, an existing 9-story reinforced concrete (RC) multi-story residential building is redesigned with cross-laminated timber floors and glue-laminated timber frames for embodied carbon reduction purposes. Firstly, the reasons behind design decisions are addressed in terms of both architecture and structure, including the incorporation of specially steel concentrically braced frames for seismic-resistance. Then, the outcomes of life cycle assessments and pushover analyses show that the RC residential building emits two times more carbon than the hybrid steel-timber residential building, and that while the hybrid building’s lateral load-capacity is less than in the RC building, its deformation capacity is higher. These results highlight the relevance of considering the carbon footprint in combination with the design decisions, which seems to be the key to introducing circular projects in seismic-prone areas.",architectural materials | buildings | construction technology | embodied carbon | life cycle assessment | seismic performance | structural design | Turkey,0,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,BAP 109,

This material has been increasingly adopted in Europe as an alternative to concrete and traditional insulation. However, hemp hurds, as the raw materials for hempcrete, are discarded in the world's largest producer (Morocco) and considered biomass waste due mainly to their association with marijuana production. Thus, research on hempcrete remained limited in Morocco, with fewer stakeholders aware of the benefits of hempcrete in green buildings. The objective of this paper is to assess the potential use of Moroccan hemp biomass in the construction industry using a life-cycle assessment comparison of a residential house in Marrakech (Morocco) with three different exterior walls systems, two insulated conventional wall systems (i.e., double hollow clay brick (DHB), composite wall (CW) with extruded polystyrene (XPS) insulation), and a bio-composite material (i.e., hempcrete) to identify environmentally preferable wall systems. Our study demonstrated that hempcrete is advantageous over other comparable conventional wall systems in terms of embodied energy and performs best in terms of the environmental performance associated with its entire life cycle achieving relatively low carbon emissions (484.42 tCO2) compared to insulated DHB and CW systems (546.27 tCO2 and 546.55 tCO2 for DHB and CW, respectively) over a lifetime of 100 years. Significant savings (i.e., 61.85–62.13 tCO2 if hempcrete is used instead of DHB and CW) can be made from the exterior wall choice for a single house. These savings become much more significant if scaled up to the national level of Moroccan homes. Consequently, by exploiting the hemp biomass currently available in Morocco, results show a reduction of 1.91 MtCO2–1.92 MtCO2, equivalent to 2.81%–2.83% of overall Moroccan emissions. Thus, strong policy support and hemp legalization in Moroccan are essential to boost and expand hempcrete utilization for a greener construction industry.",Bio-composite materials | Green buildings | Greenhouse gas emissions | Hempcrete | Life cycle assessment,0,0,,,NSFC,72071120,National Natural Science Foundation of China

The influence of parameters like density, dynamic stiffness, air flow resistivity and longitudinal wave speed of used materials on the measured sound reduction index is discussed. Especially the density and the dynamic stiffness are important material parameters to achieve a high sound reduction index of the wall constructions. Since straw is a renewable material, the environmental impacts of the different acoustically analyzed wall constructions were investigated additionally. Standardized assessment methodologies were applied on the different components and a comparison with different insulation materials was carried out. It could be shown that the use of straw leads to lower environmental impacts (demonstrated in the Global Warming Potential indicator), though, the insulation material is not the most relevant parameter of the structures. Significantly higher environmental impacts are caused by the bearing structure (metal and timber frame studs) and the planking materials. Finally, an overall comparison together with standard concrete and brick wall structures underlines the beneficial environmental properties of walls made of renewable materials with straw.",Blow in insulation | Double wall | Global warming potential | Life cycle assessment | Renewable building materials | Sound reduction index | Sound transmission loss | Straw | Temporary carbon storage,0,0,,,,WST3-F2- 525823/007–2018,

Improvements in building design contribute to reducing environmental impacts of buildings. In this context, a crucial issue is to understand which design variables should be considered while which variables could be negligible. The objective of this study is to develop a framework for assessing the influence of various design variables throughout the design process in the environmental impacts of a building over its life cycle. This methodological framework combined building information modelling and life cycle assessment tools and a global sensitivity analysis using the Morris elementary effects method. A residential building was applied to demonstrate the developed framework. The influence of six design variables in early design stages (including, floor area, aspect ratio, floor height, orientation, window-to-wall ratio and number of floors), nine variables in detailed design stages (including, structure type of external and internal walls, type of insulation material for external and internal walls, insulation material for floors, waterproofing and insulation material for roof, type of window frame, and glazing type), and four variables in construction design stages (including, type of finishing for external walls, internal walls and floors, and roof tiles) are examined. Three environmental impact criteria (including, embodied, operational, and life-cycle environmental impacts) of a building are considered. The results identified the most influential variables throughout the design process, highlighting aspect ratio in early design stage, the structure and insulation materials for walls in detailed design stages, and the roof title in construction design stages.

Timber products including Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) and glue-laminated timber beams (glulam) are a structurally sound, aesthetically pleasing, and potentially carbon reducing alternative to traditional steel or concrete framing. This study uses Life Cycle Analysis methodology to determine the total embodied carbon emissions for a four-story (10033 m2) office building using two design scenarios: a traditional design using structural steel framing and a mass timber alternative utilizing CLT and glulam. The work is founded on detailed material lists for the two building designs that were generated by an architectural contractor with both designs subject to strict evaluation regarding building and construction codes. In addition to a comparative embodied carbon emissions analysis, this study utilized building energy consumption models and existing utility data to estimate operational emissions throughout the lifetime of the building. Energy production with rooftop solar arrays was estimated to evaluate grid emissions avoidance and determine the potential to offset whole life embodied carbon emissions when evaluated over a 30-year time horizon with temporal grid emissions accounting. Three end-of-life scenarios were evaluated for the mass timber products to determine the fate of biogenic carbon stored in the wood biomass. For the three scenarios, different mass fractions were sent to the landfill, directly re-used, or processed into particleboard. Results for the cradle-to-grave embodied carbon emissions analysis show the steel design embodies 3999 t CO2-eq. (398.5 kg CO2-eq m−2) whereas the mass timber design offers an 80–99% reduction in embodied carbon totaling 50–795 t CO2-eq. (5–79 kg CO2-eq m−2) dependent on the end-of-life treatment of mass timber products. Of all the evaluated cradle-to-grave scenarios, the smallest required solar array to fully offset embodied carbon emissions in 30 years was 665 kW with the mass timber building and the end-of-life scenario where 75% of CLT and 95% of glulam were directly re-used with the remaining fractions manufactured into particleboard.

Lowering the carbon footprint of buildings requires the development of carbon-storage materials as well as novel designs that could enable multifunctional components to achieve widespread applications. Wood is one of the most abundant biomaterials on Earth and has been used for construction historically. Recent research breakthroughs on advanced engineered wood products epitomize this material’s tremendous yet largely untapped potential for addressing global sustainability challenges. In this review, we explore recent developments in chemically modified wood that will produce a new generation of engineered wood products for building applications. Traditionally, engineered wood products have primarily had a structural purpose, but this review broadens the classification to encompass more aspects of building performance. We begin by providing multiscale design principles of wood products from a computational point of view, followed by discussion of the chemical modifications and structural engineering methods used to modify wood in terms of its mechanical, thermal, optical, and energy-related performance. Additionally, we explore life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis tools for guiding future research toward environmentally friendly and economically feasible directions for engineered wood products. Finally, this review highlights the current challenges and perspectives on future directions in this research field. By leveraging these new wood-based technologies and analysis tools for the fabrication of carbon-storage materials, it is possible to design sustainable and carbon-negative buildings, which could have a significant impact on mitigating climate change.",,12,0,,,NSF,DE-EE0009702,National Science Foundation

To alleviate the environmental hazards related to cement manufacturing, supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) are employed to reduce the usage of cement in concrete. One SCM used is copper slag (CS). In this study, a life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted by investigating the environmental impacts of concrete replacing different percentage of cement with CS. As a case study, the LCA was performed for low-rise and mid-rise structures designed with varying concrete strengths, and a cost analysis was performed for these structures when replacing different percentages of cement with CS. Based on the results, the usage of CS was established as being beneficial to the impact categories ADP (Abiotic Depletion Potential (Fossil)) and GWP (Global Warming Potential), but exerted damaging effects on ADP (Abiotic Depletion Potential) and HTP (Human Toxicity Potential). On the basis of the cost analysis, the use of CS as a partial cement replacement was found to reduce building costs by a maximum of 1.4%, which is statistically significant. When evaluating the risk in comparison to the benefit of using CS in buildings, it was found that the negative environmental influence outweighed the favorable influence and cost savings resulting from the use of CS as a cement alternative. However, when only considering GWP, which is the standard procedure for environmental assessment in buildings, the use of CS as a partial cement substitute in buildings was regarded as being beneficial, yielding a 12.80% reduction in carbon emissions.",building | concrete buildings | copper slag | life cycle assessment | recycling | supplementary cementitious materials | sustainability,1,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

With the current need to reduce carbon emissions, if found to be significant, these effects might also need to be considered by agencies when making investment decisions or when evaluating pavement design and rehabilitation strategies. Several studies have evaluated rolling resistance factors such as pavement roughness, macrotexture, and structural response (SR) to loading to generate models to predict EFC. Available PVI models consider either the effects of pavement surface characteristics (PSC) or SR only, and it is not possible to estimate the total PVI-related EFC using just one model. This paper summarizes a study demonstrating the use of select PVI models for estimating EFC during the pavement design stage for a new construction or reconstruction project and attempts to combine the results of PSC models with SR models to calculate the total contribution of PVI to EFC. The results from the analysis may be helpful for evaluating alternative pavement design strategies, materials, or surface textures for inclusion in the final design and project specifications, provided the gaps and limitations of the models are well understood and considered.

Moreover, the impact of variations of future climate conditions and the carbon intensity of the electricity grid are rarely studied. This study aims to fill this gap, by developing and demonstrating a holistic whole life approach to determine the optimized wall insulation thickness of the English housing stock. The study assesses both the reduced post-retrofit operational energy and carbon, as well as the additional embodied energy and carbon from wall insulation.

The results revealed that the optimized glass wool insulation thickness varies from 0.010 m to 0.275 m, increasing wall insulation thickness further than optimized value will result in negative effects. Ignoring future variations could lead to overestimation of the reduction potential of insulation installation on whole life energy consumption, and thus emissions reduction.

In this study, the physical properties of SCLGC, such as slump flow test, T500 test, V-funnel, and J-ring tests, are examined. Furthermore, the density, Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV), compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and impact resistance are also tested to evaluate the mechanical properties of SCLGC mix with various concentrations of Sodium Hydroxide (SH) cured under different curing regimes. The aforenoted properties are examined following the American, Indian and European guidelines. In addition, microstructural analysis is conducted to assess the compactness and internal structure of SCLGC blends with varying SH concentrations cured under different curing regimes. Finally, the sustainability aspects of GPC and SCLGC mixes are analyzed through the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to evaluate the energy requirement and CO2 emission and cost. The Sustainability analysis was performed to evaluate the energy requirement and CO2 emission of SCLGC in the production of 1 m3 concrete based on the previous literatures.

The cost, carbon and energy efficiency of the SCLGC's mixes were estimated. Mix with ECA requires higher energy demand and emits high CO2 in the open atmosphere.

The aim of this investigation was to compare the environment impact, energy consumption, and life cycle cost (LCC) of different wood-based materials in identical single-story residential buildings.

Conversely, LVL generally has lower terrestrial acidification potential (TAP), human toxicity potential (HTP), and fossil depletion potential (FDP), respectively, by 30%, 17%, and 27%. The comparative outcomes revealed that using LVL reduces embodied energy by 41%. To identify which of these materials is the best alternative, various environmental categories, embodied energy, and cost criteria require further analysis. Therefore, the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method has been applied to enable robust decision-making.

Large-span structures usually consume more materials, need more complex construction processes, and thus have a larger environmental impact. In this study, the life cycle assessment of the carbon emission of space frame structures which is a classical type of large-span structure is conducted. Space frame structures with bolted spherical joints and space frame structures with welded hollow spherical joints are considered. The life cycle of a space frame structure is divided into four phases including component production, construction, maintenance, and demolition. The tiered hybrid method that combines process-based calculation and input-output analysis is adopted to evaluate the carbon emission of space frame structures. Parametrical studies on the height-span ratio and grid number are carried out using the proposed assessment scheme. The carbon emissions of the space frame structures with different types of joints are investigated and compared. It is found that lower material consumption does not always result in lower carbon emission, and thus it is necessary to evaluate the life-cycle carbon emission during lower carbon-oriented design of space frame structures. An equation for approximately and quickly estimating the carbon emission of space frame structures is fitted from the material consumption to carbon emission datum obtained from the parametrical studies. This study provides a useful reference for the carbon emission assessment and low-carbon oriented design of space frame structures.",Carbon emission | Life-cycle assessment | Material consumption | Space frame structure,3,1,repositoryvor,Green,NSFC,ZJ2021009,National Natural Science Foundation of China

A six-storey residential building is applied as a case study for a comparison between reinforced concrete (RC) and laminated bamboo lumber (LBL) construction in five representative cities. The comparison considers the inventory analysis of the materialization, operation, and end-of-life (EoL) stage, energy consumption as simulated by the commercial software IES-VE, and carbon emissions assessed by a process-based method. The results for the five cities show that the use of bamboo instead of the conventional reinforced concrete structure would reduce energy consumption by 3%∼5% and reduce CO2 emissions by 7%∼20%.

Utilization of UFS contributes toward lowering environmental impact in terms of waste management, ecological sustainability, and monetary benefits. This study consists of two sections, i.e., retaining wall design for modified backfill parameters, followed by a life cycle analysis (LCA) comparison study. Index and engineering properties of natural sand and UFS are determined for the retaining wall design based on codal specifications. As the study is aimed at evaluating life cycle assessment for construction instances where alternate materials like UFS are utilized, production, transportation, and utilization of conventional construction materials have been taken into consideration, along with the disposal of waste materials. The impact of variation in the height and type of wall is also studied. Environmental impact categories such as cumulative energy demand, human toxicity, and resource and ecosystem impact are evaluated for the cradle-To-gate variant. The software tool openLCA is used for environmental impact studies where the Ecoinvent database is considered with a mid-point approach. Factors of safety against external and internal stability of walls for different cases are considered and found to be above permissible limits. The impact categories are significantly affected and depict a loss in values when the UFS mixture is used as a retaining wall backfill. This is because UFS introduction in sand reduces earth pressure leading to savings in natural sand, concrete quantity, reinforcing steel, and fuel quantity consumed by building machines and vehicles transporting construction materials. The study concludes that in all examined impact categories, an alternative material provides a significant environmental benefit than the conventional material without compromising stability. The results demonstrate that the use of UFS is very effective as a sustainable alternative to natural sand for the backfill of retaining structures.",Life cycle assessment | Retaining wall | Sustainability | Used foundry sand,0,0,,,,undefined,

The model was applied to two wooden buildings: one with an XLAM structure and another one with a framed structure. In both cases, from the perspective of reusing the wood components for a subsequent life cycle, C and D phases of the process achieved an overall negative CO2e emission rate thanks to the offsetting from the carbon storage property of wood.

This hybrid method combines structural analysis with local component optimization. Process-based life cycle assessment was used to identify carbon-intensive and high-cost structural members, and these members were optimized using discrete design variables and complicated constraints. Furthermore, a case study was conducted on a four-story frame building, in which the embodied emissions and costs were estimated as 1270.91 tCO2e and 0.67 million USD in the initial design scheme. Beams were identified as the optimization target for this building, and a set of Pareto-optimal solutions was obtained, indicating potential emission and cost reductions of 17.9% and 12.3%, respectively, compared with the initial designs.

Steel slag (SS), an industrial waste by-product from the steel-making process, is typically disposed of in landfill which consumes land resources and pollutes the environment. This paper explores the possibility of a closed-loop system to convert steel slag into a cement material through carbonation activation, thereby significantly reducing the amount of steel slag waste sent to landfills across Canada. The production of this cementing material can occur next to the steel mill, utilizing steel slag and carbon dioxide collected on-site to fabricate carbon-negative products. To save energy and allow production to be feasible on an industrial scale, ambient pressure (AP) carbonation is developed to reduce carbon emissions while improving their performance. High pressure (HP) carbonation curing and normal hydration (NH) references were also implemented at the same time to justify the application of AP carbonation in reducing CO2 emission. The results of this study found AP carbonation-activated SS compacts have comparable CO2 uptake (about 7.5 tons CO2/100 tons slag) and mechanically compressive strength values as those subjected to HP carbonation, suggesting that AP could be used to replace HP in carbonation curing to ensure a lower energy input. Additionally, AP seemed to possess as effective carbonation as HP. The studies investigated by multiple techniques including X-ray diffractometer (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopic analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) aim to identify the microstructure development of carbonated SS paste to assess carbonation results. Developed with life cycle assessment (LCA), environmental impact evaluation shows that AP presents a smaller global warming potential (GWP) value than HP. The comparable CO2 sequestration, satisfactory engineering properties, enhanced microstructure and lesser environmental impact in AP carbonation confirm the feasibility of replacing high pressure with extremely low pressure to cure concrete products.

The consequential life cycle inventory of such products contains elementary flows with values sometimes greater sometimes less than zero. Therefore, their static assessment did not show the influence of carbon uptake and release, either during or after the temporal boundary of the system. The originality lies in the combination of the dynamic modeling of tree harvesting and growth, temporary carbon storage, end-of-life (EOL) strategies, material substitution, and characterization factors in a consequential life cycle assessment (LCA). This combination highlights the extent to which material substitution, EOL strategies, and carbon sequestration can be decisive. In addition, it addresses the static and dynamic measurements of radiative forcing (W.m−2) and the carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent (CO2eq.). In this case study, material substitution contributed the most to result, followed by post-harvest CO2 sequestration. In terms of metrics, the conventional static LCA overestimates the long-term cumulative impact on CC (tonne CO2eq.) without providing information on the short-term impact of the case study. In addition, the assessment of such a dynamic consequential life cycle inventory (LCI) with a dynamic metric provides more specific information, regardless of the temporal boundary. However, the absolute dynamic metrics (W.m−2) should support the relative dynamic metric (tonne CO2eq.1st year) to avoid misleading conclusions.",Building environment | Carbon stock | Consequential life cycle assessment | Dynamic climate change assessment | Material substitution | Wooden structure,3,0,,,NSERC,IRCPJ 461745-18,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Achieving carbon neutrality is an urgent goal due to the issues related to global warming, so herein the sustainability is necessarily assessed in terms of environmental, social, and economic metrics. Besides, structures are expected to recover their functionality after hazards efficiently. Thus, resilience describing the recovery ability of the structures needs to be assessed. A novel framework of life-cycle sustainability and resilience assessment is proposed and applied to assess the steel-SMA reinforced concrete bridge considering the stochastic process of earthquakes and functional deterioration, and the results are compared with those of the conventional bridge. The comparison results confirm that the steel-SMA reinforced concrete bridge is more sustainable and resilient under earthquakes and functional deterioration in a long-term perspective under the investigated scenarios.

Life cycle phases considered include extracting and preparing raw materials, component material production, mixing concrete and transportation occurred in the whole processes. After verifying the model, the impacts of several factors like concrete curing method, fly ash incorporation content, sea-sand transportation distance and electricity generation approach, which have never been investigated before, on the energy cost and carbon dioxide equivalent emissions generated in manufacturing SWSS-SCC were discussed. The simulated results showed that: (a) Using seawater and sea-sand slightly increases the concrete’s compressive and tensile strengths. Replacing some cement with fly ash notably decreases the early-age strengths, but curing at 60°C can offset that effect. (b) Replacing fresh water and natural sand by sea-water and sand in Humen Town decreases the production EIs of SWSS-SCC. For this concrete, cement production and raw material transportation are the main contributors to the overall EIs. (c) During producing SWSS-SCC, using electricity generated from clean fuels can effectively reduce the system’s EI, but changing fuel used to fire the cement kiln has little effect. (d) High temperature curing to increase the fly ash content is not environmentally sound. Reducing the mixture’s water to binder ratio is more benefit for incorporating fly ash.

The element, as it was conceived, is part of the “closed cycle” construction systems, in which the uniqueness of the model allows to optimize a possible industrialization process. The approach starts from the analysis of the state of the art to identify the design criteria to be adopted in the development of the innovative temporary module and to determine the search gap. After, there is the design and prototyping of the Square Box. Finally, Life Cycle Assessment provided for a quantitative assessment on greenhouse gas emissions following the ISO 14040–14044 standards. The methodology also provides for monitoring but this last phase is undergoing and it will be explained in a future article.

This paper aims to identify and assess conventional external walls in Iran. A multi-criteria scoring system is established to evaluate them regarding carbon emissions, cost benefits, and thermal performance (R-value). A selection criteria is defined, and a total of 45 external walls are identified and categorized into three wall types: solid, filled cavity, and partial cavity walls. Assessing environmental impact involves conducting a cradle-to-handover simplified life cycle assessment. Cost assessment is performed using construction costs, and thermal performance assessment is conducted based on thermal conductivity coefficient and thickness. Based on the results, the highest scores belong to partial cavity walls. Partial cavity walls perform better than simple and filled cavity walls, although the simple wall is Iran's most widely used wall solution.

Two of the most commonly used building materials are concrete and steel, but both of these industries have been identified as large sources of atmospheric CO2. Therefore, reducing the use of these materials and finding alternatives to them that meet the engineering requirements of a design, while also minimizing emissions, is becoming increasingly important. Stone in its natural form is a zero-carbon emission material and has strong physical properties that make it a viable substitute for concrete and steel, across a range of applications. Yet research into the potential use of stone by the construction industry remains rare. The aim of this research is to investigate whether the use of stone as a building product is a feasible alternative in terms of carbon emissions. This study compares data from 11 Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) that provide Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) assessments of their considered product (i.e., types of dimensional stone, concrete, or steel). However, this research also highlights some shortcomings in the EPDs that point to a need for greater legitimate engagement with this tool, and for more consistency between the data being presented in EPDs.

The results indicate that GWP values for dimensional structural stone (135 kg.CO2/m3) are 45–75% lower than the concrete products considered in this investigation (246–514 kg.CO2/m3), and over 99% lower than certain steel products (22,294–29,202 kg.CO2/m3).

Method and innovation: The innovation of this study is to propose an integrated design process to determine optimal retrofitting solutions and achieve life-cycle net-zero. The retrofitting also aims at maximising lifetime payback cost by selecting appropriate installation areas or capacities of each renewable energy device. A real-world office building is adopted as a case study to demonstrate the proposed retrofitting design approach, while 5 different sceneries are adopted to demonstrate different retrofitting situations. Results and implication: The maximum lifetime payback cost reduction would be 116.3% and 103.5% for life-cycle net-zero energy and carbon for this case study building. The proposed integrated design process can be applied to different types of buildings to transform them into truly carbon-neutral and consequently mitigate climate change-related issues.",Building retrofitting | Embodied carbon | Life cycle assessment | Life-cycle net-zero | Office building | Renewable energy,4,0,,,BEIS,TEIF-101-7025,"Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, UK Government"

Following the earthquake, approximately 7500 dwellings and 1400 commercial properties were demolished, resulting in 4 million tons of building debris. Using the Canterbury event, and the subsequent building demolitions in Christchurch as a case study, this research quantifies the embodied carbon and energy costs associated with the post-earthquake demolition of buildings prior to the end of their intended design life. A building data set consisting of 142 reinforced concrete buildings that were demolished following the event was used to estimate the total amount of structural and non-structural debris resulting from the demolitions. A framework was developed to calculate the global warming potential of the demolished buildings considering embodied CO2 and energy in the building materials, impacts of the processes used in construction of the building, and CO2 emissions of the transport and waste management processes. A life cycle assessment tool was used to calculate the environmental costs in the production and transport module, the spatial distribution of the waste based on the building locations was calculated to determine transport distances to disposal facilities, and the waste disposal and recycling benefits were calculated using values from a life cycle inventory database. The results of the research revealed the demolition of concrete buildings had staggering environmental costs in terms of embodied CO2 and energy, which make the case for both resilient design strategies that reduce waste and pollution following earthquakes, and incorporating environmental impacts into demolition decisions.",earthquake damage | embodied carbon | environmental impacts | life cycle assessment | Post-earthquake demolitions,3,0,,,,0743,QuakeCoRE

However, applying green energy resources is not a panacea for solving existing industrial pollution as environmental problems cannot be solved with the level of optimized energy types. Instead, it is necessary to further explore the potential carbon emissions from clean energy resources. Therefore, we construct a polysilicon PV system’s whole life cycle carbon emission model by applying the LCA method and further building the emission coefficient model. More specifically, we divided the system’s carbon emissions into six components and calculated each part separately. In addition, we further applied the case analysis method. We analyzed the carbon emissions of the 280 MW solar cell production project of a leading global PV module company in China.

Results show that environmental indicator results of the electrolytic nickel production from the leaching electrowinning method were 17.7%–40.2% lower than those from the grind and flotation electrolytic method. At the endpoint level, the nickel mining and beneficiation stages contributed 54.7%–65.91% of human health damage, 83.0%–84.7% of ecosystem quality damage and 80.8%–83.7% of resources damage.

These parameters had negligible effects on the amounts and types of hydrophilic functional groups of geopolymer surfaces. A combination of organic surface modifiers and geopolymer coatings was shown to ensure hydrophobic surface conditions and great durability. Silicon-based modifiers exhibited better wetting performance than capillary crystalline surfactants by eliminating hydroxyl groups and maintaining structural backbone Si-O-T (Si, Al) on geopolymers’ surfaces. Finally, life-cycle analysis was conducted to investigate the environmental performance. Geopolymer coating yielded substantially lower environmental impacts (50–80% lower in most impact categories) than ordinary Portland cement (OPC) coating.

The infrastructure sector causes substantial CO2 emissions, and it is one of the most polluting sectors. Fly ash (FA) is often used in bridges to reduce CO2 emissions. Moreover, the lack of temporal information is an important limitation of the life cycle CO2 assessment of bridges. Taking the upper structure of small and medium span bridges as the research object, this paper proposes a Monte Carlo simulation-based life cycle multi-objective dynamic maintenance strategy optimization model to analyze the life-cycle carbon emissions, costs, and life cycle reliability of different preventive maintenance (PM) and essential maintenance (EM) methods of FA reinforced concrete (RC) beams. Considering the continuous effect of carbon emissions and the net present value of the cost, the time effect of carbon emissions and costs of maintenance and reinforcement at different times is analyzed. Through 50,000 simulations of the case beam, the parameter characteristics of different optimal reinforcement schemes and the relationship between the reliability, life cycle CO2 emissions, and costs are studied. When introducing the discount rate, the essential maintenance with higher carbon emissions and costs has a marginal effect, i.e., the longer that future carbon emissions and costs occur, the smaller the net present value. The proposed method is demonstrated to be effective at supporting decision making for bridge managers. It would be helpful for identifying the effectiveness of PM and EM, selecting optimal maintenance time interval, and providing a rational estimate of the CO2 emissions and costs of bridges.",Carbon dioxide | Cost | Maintenance | Reliability | Small and medium span bridges | Time effect,1,0,,,BJUT,undefined,Beijing University of Technology

However, the senior engineers can be biased towards solutions inside their area of expertise, which often prevents them from finding the best solutions among alternatives that must consider complex inter-related, and multi-disciplinary parameters. The engineering community could benefit from a rapid and high-quality decision-making method or tool to increase the speed and quality of its high-impact design choices. There are valuable studies in the literature exploiting Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the structural design process; however, most of them focus on the final design stage (e.g., Building Information Modeling), and the rest requires an existing project database (e.g., architectural drawings, already decided material types) to propose a small number of initial design alternatives. In this article, we present the development and validation of a genetic algorithm tool based on Non-dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) that can be used to analyse a wide range of safe, economical and low-CO2 options for the conceptual design of buildings. The design space starts from a design brief (with only the information about the site characteristics and project objectives). The solutions are explored with the material, grid size, floor type, lateral resistance, and foundation system variables. In a short computational time (< 2 min per run), users are provided with a Pareto graph of a large set of feasible solutions (in terms of cost, embodied CO2 emissions and free space) that an engineer would not be typically able to evaluate within a traditional conceptual design process. For future applications, the methodology presented in this paper is flexible to include more engineering materials (e.g., timber, masonry, structural glass), complex architectural forms and merge other disciplines in decision making (e.g., building physics construction management, fire safety).",Conceptual design | Conceptual structural design | Cost-efficient structural design | Decision support | Design space exploration | Embodied carbon | Genetic algorithm | Life cycle analysis | Multi-criteria decision making | Multi-objective genetic algorithm | Non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm | Preliminary structural design,3,0,,,,undefined,

These phenomena can be addressed with the use of pervious concrete pavement (PCP) systems, which have gained acceptance as sustainable alternatives to conventional materials. However, implementation of PCP technology is limited to low-volume roads, sidewalks, and parking lots attributed to low strength and the need for high quality control during construction compared to traditional pavements along with limited understanding on the end-of-life significance due to the green PCP product. Therefore, the major objective of this research was to develop a pavement system with superior structural and hydrological performance characteristics over traditional PCP, while also quantifying the energy consumed, amount of GHG produced, and costs associated with its design and construction. Thus, a Pervious All-Road All-weather Multilayered pavement (PARAMpave) was conceptualized and designed that comprised a 300 mm square paver block created with a 60 mm lower structural layer overlaid with a 30 mm water-draining surface wearing course pervious concrete layer. The major properties of PARAMpave products included porosity ranging from 17% to 24%, permeability varying from 0.77 cm/s to 1.33 cm/s, and flexural strength between 4.83 MPa and 6.13 MPa, indicating their improved structural and hydrological performance compared to traditional designs. Further, a cradle-to-gate lifecycle approach was utilized to perform a comparative evaluation between PARAMpave and Portland cement concrete (PCC) paver blocks. The PARAMpave products consumed lower energy (8.22% to 8.51%) and emitted lower GHGs (8.23% to 8.43%) compared to PCC blocks of similar dimensions. Additionally, PARAMpave blocks were about 10% cheaper and almost 10% lighter than a PCC paver block.

In doing so, it measures the variability in inventory databases, transportation distance, lifetime of building components, biogenic carbon emissions, carbonation of concrete materials and end-of-life scenarios. Through the use of Monte Carlo analysis, the research found that the embodied carbon of a mass timber building ranged from 196 kgCO2-e/m2 to 590 kgCO2-e/m2 with a mean of 417 kgCO2-e/m2. For a post-tensioned concrete building the range was 307 kgCO2-e/m2 to 618 kgCO2-e/m2 with a mean of 465 kgCO2-e/m2. This equates to a 48 kgCO2-e/m2 reduction in mean embodied carbon for the mass timber building. Using deterministic analysis, previous research suggested a more substantive 129 kgCO2-e/m2 reduction. These results demonstrate that mass timber buildings do typically have a lower embodied carbon, compared to concrete buildings, however the significance of this depends on the assumptions made, and the input data used. For the concrete building, the variation in embodied carbon is primarily influenced by the inventory data and building products' lifetime. The greater range of embodied carbon in the mass timber building is due to variations associated with the inventory data, allocation of biogenic carbon emissions (sequestration, and forest management losses) and, different end-of-life scenarios associated with timber products. Despite this, the research suggests that with a carefully planned end-of-life strategy, mass timber mid-rise buildings have the potential to benefit from lower embodied carbon emissions, as compared to concrete buildings, across their full lifecycle.",Cross-laminated timber | Embodied carbon | Lifecycle analysis | Mass timber structure | Monte Carlo simulation | Uncertainty analysis,6,0,,,CRC,RP1034,CRC Health Group

In this paper, LCA was used during the early design stage of a circular bio-based wall panel prototype to guide the decision-making process for the improvement of the panel's design. A cradle-to-cradle life cycle assessment was performed to compare the circular wall panel against other prefabricated wall panels, assembled using common construction materials and techniques. Results indicated that a circular design and some bio-based materials are not always synonymous with low environmental impacts. The first iteration of the circular panel had a GWP100 of 231.1 kgCO2e/m2 in the base case with one life cycle. This compared to 116 kgCO2e/m2 and 181 kgCO2e/m2 for the timber and steel frame panels respectively. The LCA was able to identify materials and components which contribute most significantly to the panels environmental impact. The identification of highly impacting materials in the initial panel design, LCA was used to guide the re-design of the circular bio-based panel. From investigating alternative materials for the insulation, cladding and internal substrate the environmental impact of the new design of the circular panel was lowered to 122 kgCO2e/m2.

For LCA, the expected life span of the buildings was taken into account (60 years for the modern school and 140 years for the historic one), as well as all life cycle stages (product, construction, use, end of life, beyond building life). Various indicators were assessed, such as Global Warming Potential (GWP), Fossil Fuel Consumption, Total Primary Energy, Non-Renewable Primary Energy. From the correlation of the results, it was asserted that although the two buildings present similar operational characteristics and needs, they have different environmental performances and impacts, mainly attributed to their different service life and structural characteristics. Although the operational GWP value of the historic building is higher (due to the extended life span), the embodied one is significantly lower (due to the natural materials used for its construction).

Many universities have picked up the challenge and quantified their carbon footprints; however, up-to-date quantification is limited to use-phase emissions. So far, data on embodied impacts of university campus infrastructure are missing, which prevents us from evaluating their life cycle costs. In this paper, we quantify the embodied impacts of two university campuses of very different sizes and climate zones: the Umwelt Campus Birkenfeld (UCB), Germany, and the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. We also quantify the effects of switching to full renewable energy supply on the carbon footprint of a university campus based on the example of UCB. The embodied impacts amount to 13.7 (UCB) and 26.2 (NTU) kg CO2e/m2•y, respectively, equivalent to 59.2% (UCB), and 29.8% (NTU), respectively, of the building lifecycle impacts. As a consequence, embodied impacts can be dominating; thus, they should be quantified and reported. When adding additional use-phase impacts caused by the universities on top of the building lifecycle impacts (e.g., mobility impacts), both institutions happen to exhibit very similar emissions with 124.5–126.3 kg CO2e/m2•y despite their different sizes, structures, and locations.

Solutions on the track to carbon-neutral construction and operation can only be achieved through a holistic approach that includes the use of resources. The approach spans from questions about the necessity and size of a building (build less), through a planned re-use of components and the reduction of material in the design process (build clever), to the selection of materials based on their specific grey emissions (build efficiently) in a tight circulation system (minimise waste). A uniform assessment of the efficiency of resources and emissions for bridge structures is currently not possible due to the lack of internationally coordinated regulations. Using the example of the Campusbrücke in Opladen, Leverkusen, a footbridge built in 2013, the paper explores the different practical approaches that have contributed to a reduction of emissions and used resources.

HTPBE walls analyzed in this work include Double stud walls, Structural Insulated Panels (SIP), and Insulated Concrete Form (ICF). Results show that using R-50 HTPBE can decrease about 85 % of the HVAC energy consumption, which brings 80% natural gas saving compared to the baseline.

These values range 9492 and 47618 kg CO2 eq for Structural Insulated Panels (SIP) that may use different insulations (expanded polystyrene-EPS- and extruded polystyrene-XPS). Also, the CO2 emissions of ICF are between 9200 and 22600 kg CO2 eq at the product stage. Comparing the kg CO2 emissions of scenarios to their weights shows that ICF R-17 and R-50 have the lowest CO2 emissions compared with other R-17 and R-50 scenarios.

The methodology consists of parametric construction-typological analysis, automated through One Click LCA software (Life Cycle Assessment) and Microsoft Excel with 21 alternate designs and 630 iterations.

Nowadays, a lot of EU regulations request nature-based engineering solutions such as soil and water bioengineering techniques (SWBE). In contrast to conventional ‘hard’ civil engineering structures, the idea of SWBE structures is the use of biological components in the engineering structure to not just consider a technical function, but also ecological and aesthetic values. While SWBE techniques are applied worldwide and well established as an engineering discipline, there is a high demand on the further development specifically in terms of ecology. The use of plants in river engineering projects requires the right choice of species depending on the techniques used and the environmental conditions. Furthermore, a right harvest, storage and implementation of the plants is significant. Their use also requires the quantification of the hydraulic and sedimentological impact of riparian vegetation on the one hand and on the other hand to know the impact of SWBE structures on the aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Different ecological, vegetational and phytosociological criterias are available and discussed in terms of assessment of SWBE structures. All these criteria can be helpful to develop a framework supporting stakeholders to define objectives, design, implementation work and to assess the post-construction lifetime phase, which is most relevant for SWBE structures. From a wider point of view, when looking at the multitaxonomic diversity in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats, it has been shown that SWBE techniques could enhance global riparian habitat quality by allowing a greater richness and density of pioneer tree species. The use of phytosociology has become more important for the application of SWBE structures as nature-based vegetation composition. Specific challenges arise for river managers and practitioners with invasive alien species and climate change forcing us to redefine what is meant by ‘non-native’ species. Therefore, using a local and historical phytosociological typology to define the reference to be achieved could become increasingly misleading. By analyzing the ecological value of SWBE structures, another aspect must be considered from an ecological point of view. The possible negative impacts on ecosystems caused by SWBE measures, during the period of construction (e.g., emissions, energy consumption, intervention in nature) should be taken into consideration. A popular methodology to provide the possibility of achieving a better understanding of environmental burdens and to assess the potential environmental impact of products or services is environmental life cycle assessment (LCA). We are faced with the problems of climate change which means that we have to optimize our civil engineering (including SWBE) construction activities in terms of positive effects, for example urban heat islands or carbon storage and also any potential negative effects, for example emission of greenhouse gases or energy demand. We must critically examine our model of the SWBE approach, the application of SWBE techniques does not automatically mean an ecological improvement. SWBE systems are dynamic and always different, depending on their field of application. A harmonization of strategies and goals needs to be developed in order to support coherent measures aimed at improving the ecological status of river bodies, coastal areas and at the same time, guaranteeing hydraulic safety and adequate protection of human activities from hydromorphological hazards (flooding, floodplain erosion, failure of river and coastal-related infrastructures).",,6,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,

The CO2 emission of the MOC panel is 37.3 (kg CO2 eq/m2), which is at least 22% less than the CO2 emission of PC concrete-based scenarios (105 kg CO2 eq/m2 for tilt-up and 48 kg CO2 eq/m2 for ICF). The CO2 emission of wooden-based scenarios ranges between 19.12 and 28.7 (kg CO2 eq/m2) which is lower than MOC panels. However, there are physical and technical limitations for wooden-based wall products that encourage their replacement with MOC panels. The sensitivity analysis shows that adding 1 kg MgO to the MOC boards leads to 1.4 kg increase in CO2 emissions. Additionally, 1kWh energy saving in the production process provides 1 kg less CO2 emissions.",Building envelope | Life cycle assessment | Magnesium oxide | Magnesium oxychloride cement | Portland cement,0,0,,,,undefined,Mitacs

This paper presents a parametric optimization and decision support (POD) model framework that enables automated structural analysis and simultaneous calculation of life cycle cost (LCC), life cycle assessment (LCA), recycling potential and flexibility assessment. A method for integrating production planning into early structural design extends the framework to consider the impact of changing production processes on the footprint of building structures already at an early design stage. With the introduction of a novel grading system, design teams can quickly compare the performance of different building variants to improve decision making. The POD model framework is tested by means of a variant study on a pilot project from a food and hygiene production facility. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework for identifying potential economic and environmental savings, specifying alternative building materials, and finding low-impact industrial structures and enclosure variants. When comparing the examined building variants, significant differences in the LCC (63%), global warming potential (62%) and flexibility (55%) of the structural designs were identified.

To enhance the carbon reduction potential, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the impact of the use of a wood structural system, recycled concrete replacement, and photovoltaic power generation. The use of a wood structure system can achieve zero or negative carbon emissions in the production stage. The sensitivity of the carbon emissions of the nearly zero energy building (nZEB) to the increment of photovoltaic power generation is much higher than that of the recycled concrete replacement rate, providing a basis for further exploration of the development of nZEBs into zero carbon buildings.",Carbon emissions | Life cycle assessment | Nearly zero energy buildings | Potential | Sensitivity analysis,6,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,MOHURD,[2019]003,Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development

This paper presents a comprehensive review of the thermal and mechanical properties of straw-based materials and buildings. The objective is to synthesis the work that has been carried out by the research community and to compare the results. The paper first introduces straw bale as a construction material from a historical viewpoint and in the context of the current building sector. The second part focuses on the available chemical and microstructural data of the straw fiber. The third part refers to the thermophysical and mechanical properties of the bales. The fourth part reviews the numerical and experimental studies done at the wall scale. The fifth part describes straw bale construction methods considering the regulation, structure requirements, and life cycle assessment data. Last, a critical analysis of the currently available data on straw as a building material is carried out and pending research issues are discussed. It was found that, despite abundant literature on structural and thermal properties of straw bale constructions, there is still a lack of some information. At a fiber scale, more research should be done to compare straw fibers to other natural and synthetic fibers. At a bale scale, further pH-related research is needed because it affects the material's interior conditions and durability. In addition, a thermal conductivity model for straw should be developed. On a bigger scale, the hygrothermal characteristics of various types of walls must be measured and computed experimentally and theoretically under various exterior and internal situations. More research is needed to improve the sound resistance of the straw wall by adding new layers capable of absorbing acoustic waves. Studies on the energy behavior, cost analysis, and how interior air moisture is self-regulated in straw buildings are needed at the building size. Therefore, a lack of consistent data among the different studies was noted depending on the straw characteristics.",Bio-based material | Life cycle assessment | Mechanical properties | Straw bale construction | Thermal behavior,10,0,,,,undefined,

Therefore, this paper aims to explore appropriate building envelope design solutions by examining the trade-off between EC and OC of high-rise residential buildings. To achieve this aim, the life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate the EC and OC of the residential buildings using SimaPro and DesignBuilder software. A building information modelling (BIM) model was developed to extract the geometric data and material consumption. A typical 30-story public residential building in Hong Kong was examined. The EC and OC of the case building were calculated as 561 kg CO2e/m2 and 50.18 kg CO2e/m2/yr, respectively. Different low carbon design scenarios were identified from the literature review and the semi-structured interviews with designers and contractors. Results indicate that low carbon concrete is an effective approach for not only reducing the EC by 5%-15%, but saving a mild percentage of OC, and is therefore encouraged. However, changing the thickness of external walls leads to a very limited life cycle carbon reduction (0.99%). Lower U-value of envelopes is recommended as 2.84% and 2.89% life cycle carbon is reduced when adopting insulations for external walls and triple-glazing windows.

Additionally, the user costs instigated by traffic interruption during the maintenance of deteriorated bridges yields a significant portion of the total costs. Carbon emission and consequent climate change issues are the substantial factors of concern in recent years. Hence, employments of low carbon technologies are crucial to combat climate change ensuring sustainable infrastructures. In this perspective, a challenging initiative for ultra-high durability low carbon prestressed concrete bridge utilizing sustainable zero cement concrete (STC-ZERO) and non-metallic reinforcement is undertaken. STC-ZERO incorporating ferronickel slag sand, ultra-low water to binder ratio, blast furnace slag, fly ash, silica fume and expansive additive achieves 150 MPa compressive strength, exceptionally low shrinkage and creep. More importantly, it reduces carbon emission up to 70% compared to the conventional concrete as cement is entirely replaced. Likewise, the non-metallic Aramid fibre reinforced polymer (AFRP) PC tendons have no factor of deterioration of concrete thanks to nonexistence of corrosion. AFRP tendon exhibits excellent fatigue resistance and equivalent tensile strength as PC steel strands. Elastic modulus of AFRP is 1/4th of steel contributing to low prestress loss due to shrinkage and creep. As STC-ZERO exhibits low pH value, the combination of AFRP and STC-ZERO is amazingly practicable. Accordingly, an ASSTHO-PCI BT-72 PC girder is designed incorporating this challenging combination and compared with the similar conventional girder with respect to structural performance and whole life carbon emissions. Since, there is no repair and rehabilitation requirements, the highly durable BT-72 girder with STC-ZERO and AFRP is expected to reduce the whole life carbon credit by 80% compensating the initial cost for ultra-high durability low carbon technologies and lessening entire lifecycle costs.",carbon emission | life cycle assessment (LCA) | non-metallic bridge | ultra-high durability | zero-cement concrete (STC-ZERO),1,0,,,,undefined,

Due to the increasing demand for renewable construction materials, the use of mixed timber-concrete solutions for high-rise structures is attracting more interest: concrete provides adequate stiffness, while timber reduces the embodied carbon of the building, including reductions in construction and demolition waste and improved recyclability. Nevertheless, in earthquake-prone countries, advanced technologies should be used to mitigate the seismic risk of high-rise buildings, considering that slight-to-moderate level of damage can produce substantial economic losses and significant environmental impact. This paper investigates the application of timber-concrete post-tensioned dissipative connections for high-rise buildings in seismic zones. These low-damage connections are able to reduce the post-earthquake residual drift and minimize the damage, thereby reducing direct and indirect losses. Furthermore, dry jointed connections allows for a flexible design approach and advantages in the construction phases. This approach is investigated through two designed case studies: a traditional concrete monolithic (cast-in-situ) building vs. a low-damage timber-concrete solution. Nonlinear dynamic analyses are performed to compare the structural/seismic responses of the case studies. A life-cycle analysis of the two buildings is developed to assess the environmental footprint, also accounting for the probable maximum losses associated with seismic damage. Results demonstrate the great efficacy of the low-damage technology for high-rise buildings: both the post-earthquake economic losses and the environmental impact are reduced by more than 40% when compared to the traditional building system.",,0,0,,,H2020,101029605,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

The change in material selection is inversely proportional to the budget as the project progresses. Given the fact that early-stage design processes often do not include environmental performance metrics, there is an opportunity to investigate a toolset that enables early-stage design processes to integrate this type of analysis into the preferred workflow of concept designers. The value here is that early-stage environmental feedback can inform the crucial decisions that are made in the beginning, giving a greater chance for a building with better environmental performance in terms of its life cycle. This paper presents the development of a tool called LearnCarbon, as a plugin of Rhino3d, used to educate architects and engineers in the early stages about the environmental impact of their design. It facilitates two neural networks trained with the Embodied Carbon Benchmark Study by Carbon Leadership Forum, which learns the relationship between building geometry, typology, and construction type with the Global Warming potential (GWP) in tons of C02 equivalent (tCO2e). The first one, a regression model, can predict the GWP based on the massing model of a building, along with information about typology and location. The second one, a classification model, predicts the construction type given a massing model and target GWP.

Preliminary research shows that hempcrete can be printed at a relatively low density of 660 kg/m3 and achieve an adequate buildability and compressive strength for printing individual wall elements. At this density, hempcrete has a thermal conductivity of 0.133 W/(m·K), unable to provide the adequate thermal resistance at average wall thickness, so high-density hempcrete should be printed as an outer wall shell (similar to Contour Crafting) and the middle filled with lower density thermal insulation hempcrete. By calculating the CO2 emissions of such printed 400-620 mm thick walls, it was found that they absorb from 1.21 to 16.7 kg of CO2 per m2, thus, such material could reduce the negative environmental impact of the construction industry while improving its productivity through 3D printing.",Bio-based materials | ecological materials | environmental impact | hemp | life cycle assessment (LCA) | lime,2,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,ERDF,1.1.1.2/VIAA/3/19/394,European Regional Development Fund

Several active- and passive solutions and strategies have been developed and proposed in the literature. Among them, wood is highlighted as a promising solution to minimize GHG from buildings. However, the benefits, especially in the circular economy, are not fully evaluated due to methodological choices. Motivated by this knowledge gap, this article aims to evaluate the benefits of wood reuse compared to traditional building construction solutions. For this purpose, we have calculated the environmental impacts of a building situated in Graz, Austria. Four different scenarios are considered. The first scenario is a fully reinforced concrete building. The second scenario is a structural beam-column made from reinforced concrete with walls made of concrete blocks. The third scenario is a beam-column made from reinforced concrete with external walls based on clay blocks. Finally, the last scenario is a full wooden building. Following the standardized life cycle assessment (LCA) method, global warming potential (GWP) is calculated through a 0/0 approach. These evaluations were made possible by correlating the impacts released from producing wooden elements and the uptake of biogenic carbon from the forest. Without considering the possibility of material reuse, the wooden structure has a 5 % lower GWP value than the reinforced concrete building. Comparatively, the other building scenarios have almost similar impacts as the building in reinforced concrete. In the case of material reuse, the wooden structure building shows potential to develop projects with 44% lower environmental impacts.",circular economy | life cycle assessment | material flow analysis | multi cycling | wooden construction,1,1,repositoryam,Green,,ACRP11 KR18AC0K14693,"TU Graz, Internationale Beziehungen und Mobilitätsprogramme"

However, as simply reducing emissions is not sufficient to meet the climate targets, using bio-based materials seems the only feasible choice as it permits carbon storage in buildings. Various studies have shown that bio-based materials allow turning overall life cycle impacts negative, therefore, having a cooling effect on the climate. In recent years, scholars and policy makers have focused almost exclusively on the advancement of wooden buildings. Timber structures stand out as they can be prefabricated and used for high-rise buildings. Yet, one important aspect seems to be overlooked: the consideration of supply and demand. Large forest areas that allow sustainable sourcing of woody biomass only exist in the Northern hemisphere, notably in North America and Europe. In these regions, though, urbanization rates are mostly stagnating, meaning new construction rates are low. The largest amount of material requirements in these regions are derived from the refurbishment of the existing stock. Moreover, in areas where structural material is needed for new construction, in Asia, Africa and South America, rain forests need to be protected. Therefore, we need to rethink the desire to find one solution and carelessly implement it everywhere. Instead, we need to consider locally available material and know-how for grounded material choices. This paper explores the supply of a range of bio-based materials and matches it against the material demand of global building stocks. It is based on various previous studies by the authors, of South Africa, China, Portugal, and more. The analysis divides between structural materials for new construction, such as wood and bamboo, and thermal insulation materials for the refurbishment of existing buildings, such as straw and hemp.

Several examples of LCCA analyses for transportation infrastructure projects and more specific for the selection of best paving materials (asphalt concrete or Portland cement concrete) and pavement treatment alternatives will be explained. Reliability and accuracy of any LCCA depends on many factors in this process. Some important factors that impact the output of this process could be: estimated costs, activity times, analysis periods, and how to consider future uncertainties such as inflation. The impact of these factors and their attributes on LCCA results will be discussed. A new trend in LCCA is to consider the impact of environmental, social, and users’ costs; however, the complexity of these inputs and how to determine their associated costs are immense challenges. It is critical that infrastructure engineers be aware of capabilities and limitations of any LCCA.

Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is proposed as a prime example of innovative building products, revolutionising the use of timber in multi-storey construction. Therefore, an understanding of the synergy between structural engineering design solutions and climate impact of CLT is essential. In this study, the carbon footprint of a CLT multi-storey building is analysed in a life cycle perspective and strategies to optimise this are explored through a synergy approach, which integrates knowledge from optimised CLT utilisation, connections in CLT assemblies, risk management in building service-life and life cycle analysis. The study is based on emerging results in a multi-disciplinary research project to improve the competitiveness of CLT-based building systems through optimised structural engineering design and reduced climate impact. The impacts associated with material production, construction, service-life and end-of-life stages are analysed using a process-based life cycle analysis approach. The consequences of CLT panels and connection configurations are explored in the production and construction stages, the implications of plausible replacement scenarios are analysed during the service-life stage, and in the end-of-life stage the impacts of connection configuration for post-use material recovery and carbon footprint are analysed. The analyses show that a reduction of up to 43% in the life cycle carbon footprint can be achieved when employing the synergy approach.

One of the earliest design decisions architects and developers should make to design a circular building is to determine the building's construction system. The choice of constructive and structural systems, such as columns, beams, and slabs, is crucial to upgrade the reuse cycles in the future. Flexible construction systems can make it easier to dismantle the structures and recover, upgrade, modify, or transform building materials. Therefore, this paper assesses the carbon emission impacts of two construction systems for an office building in Belgium using life cycle assessment (LCA) and circularity criteria. One-Click LCA software was used for the calculations. Parametric analysis took place for two construction systems scenarios involving a steel structure and a timber structure. Life Cycle Assessment and comparisons of the various construction systems are made based on ISO 14040, 14044, and CEN/TC 350 standards with a focus on carbon neutrality. The results show that using local plant-based materials such as wood can drastically reduce office buildings' carbon footprint. Based on the sensitivity analysis results, the overall global warming potential impact is mostly sensitive to the construction material's weight and reuse and dismantling ability.

While most of the studies focus on the buildings' operational phase, a substantial part of buildings' energy consumption is disguised as embodied energy. It is impossible to have a zero energy building, as it is necessary to use materials to build the building, and those materials need to produce and transport energy. Life cycle analysis is the utmost efficient method to assess how a building affects the environment. Notably, the impact of buildings on the environment across their lifespans are determined by some factors, which comprise materials, design, construction, use and demolition. The study aims to present the implementation of a life cycle approach and occupant thermal comfort during the school building's energy efficiency design. The study's principal objective focuses on the energy use and environmental impact linked to various alternatives of building envelopes in different climates. Within this context, a reference building located in three different climatic regions of Turkey is investigated. Two ranges of efficiency comprise the focal points of the study. Cost-optimal and nearly zero energy levels are defined for each city. In the hot climate, the cost-optimal scenario cannot improve the comfort conditions, whereas the nZEB scenario improves slightly in such a context. In temperate and cold climates, both strategies can improve comfort conditions.

However, environmental concerns such as the carbon effect of the final product receive less attention. Due to increasing emissions awareness within the society, there have been calls from the public for greater environmental and social accountability. While many client organizations seek to add environmental measures to their tender selection criteria, efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the building construction are not well understood. This paper proposes that by selecting appropriate structural parameters and building sites, the construction of buildings will be in accordance with a low carbon footprint intensity (CFI). This is demonstrated by the analysis of various factories producing structural materials, along with a wide range of residential buildings. It was found that through the replacement of steel structures with concrete structures, a 24.46% decrease (69.97 kg/m2) in the CFI of structures will be achieved. It was also found that replacing an eight-story steel structure with two different four-story structures will result in a 35.94% (127.82 kg/m2) reduction in carbon intensity. In addition, a 14.44% (47.64 kg/m2) reduction in the CFI of a steel structure located in a site with stiff soil was observed by relocating it to a very dense soil site. This figure for a concrete structure was 13.94% (34.87 kg/m2). It is hoped that project managers and client organizations find the results of this research useful when deciding on structural parameters with lower carbon emissions.

Conventional retrofitting solutions are generally based upon decreasing operating energy usage or corresponding costs. However, many of these would increase the embodied carbon and energy. The innovation of this paper is to develop a building retrofitting assessment and optimisation approach to select the optimal combination of retrofitting options to minimise its carbon emissions, economic costs and energy usage over its life cycle. A real-life three-floor real-world office building is implemented to exhibit the behaviour of the newly developed retrofitting assessment and optimisation approach. This paper mainly focuses on passive options, including improving envelope thermal properties (e.g. wall insulations, roof insulations and triple-glazed windows) and installing renewable energy devices (e.g. photovoltaic panel, solar heater and wind turbine). The effects of varying embodied carbon, investment cost, embodied energy, annual salvage ratio, and material recycle ratio on the life cycle behaviour of the retrofitted building is investigated. For cost optimisation, the selection priority is sheep wool for roof insulation, insulation board for wall insulation, solar heater and wind turbine. The selection priority for energy or carbon optimisation would be insulation board for wall insulation, sheep wool for roof insulation, solar heater, triple-glazed window, and wind turbine.

This paper uses Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to explore whether glue-laminated timber (glulam) has a significantly lower whole-life embodied carbon (Global Warming Potential; GWP) than functionally-equivalent structural steel. Alongside a baseline assessment that follows standard practice, a variety of further sensitivity analyses establish how differing assumptions affect results. Assessment found that the GWPs were highly dependent on: (1) the assumed end-of-life scenarios; (2) the approach used to consider biogenic CO2, and; (3) whether the timing of emissions was considered. In general, glulam had the lowest GWP when incinerated (with energy recovery) at end-of-life. However, when recycling is modelled according to current standards, glulam GWPs were in amongst those of steel, giving no clear ranking of materials. Landfilled glulam had a lower GWP than steel if some biogenic carbon was assumed to be permanently stored. That may be appropriate given recent guidance from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but is not allowed in the updated standards for LCA of construction products (e.g. EN 15804:2019). Six additional impact categories were also assessed to give a broader environmental comparison. The relative impact of the two materials depended on the impact category assessed, with glulam generally having a similar or lower impact than steel.

This study adopts a mixed-method approach of data collection, to investigate the key challenges and opportunities associated with promoting high-value recovery options for façade products, as perceived by stakeholders in the façade supply-chain. Data was initially collected through an online survey completed by 69 stakeholders from across the façade knowledge/supply-chain. This was followed by 29 semi-structured interviews with selected survey respondents. It emerged that the advancement of circular design strategies is dependent on: increased awareness and quantification of the environmental value of circular design; cross-supply-chain buy-in on developments in take-back infrastructure including greater support for demolition contractors; and advancements in technological separation methods specific to façade components. Enhanced communication between stakeholders - notably between clients, facade contractors and material processors - acceptability criteria and product availability; and more holistic legislation based on whole life cycle emissions, to avoid the over-emphasis on operational efficiency, appear as vital requisites to increasing material efficiency. Finally, we illustrate where stakeholder priorities related to reuse converge and diverge, and thus we identify strategies for levering these factors to minimise environmental impact and optimise economic value in the façade sector.",Circular economy | Design-for-disassembly | Embodied carbon | End-of-life | Façades | Recycling | Reuse,14,0,repositoryvor,Green,EPSRC,EP/L016095/1,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council

A significant part of those estimates depends on long-lived wood products in the construction sector replacing concrete, steel, and other non-renewable goods. Often the climate change mitigation benefits of this substitution are presented and quantified in the form of displacement factors. A displacement factor is numerically quantified as the reduction in emissions achieved per unit of wood used, representing the efficiency of biomass in decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. The substitution benefit for a given wood use scenario is then represented as the estimated change in emissions from baseline in a study’s modelling framework. The purpose of this review is to identify and assess the central economic and technical assumptions underlying forest carbon accounting and life cycle assessments that use displacement factors or similar simple methods. Main text: Four assumptions in the way displacement factors are employed are analyzed: (1) changes in harvest or production rates will lead to a corresponding change in consumption of wood products, (2) wood building products are substitutable for concrete and steel, (3) the same mix of products could be produced from increased harvest rates, and (4) there are no market responses to increased wood use. Conclusions: After outlining these assumptions, we conclude suggesting that many studies assessing forest management or products for climate change mitigation depend on a suite of assumptions that the literature either does not support or only partially supports. Therefore, we encourage the research community to develop a more sophisticated model of the building sectors and their products. In the meantime, recognizing these assumptions has allowed us to identify some structural, production, and policy-based changes to the construction industry that could help realize the climate change mitigation potential of wood products.",Climate change mitigation | Displacement factor | Long-lived wood products | Substitution benefit,32,1,repositoryvor,Green,"CBR, CBR-UBC",undefined,"Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia"

EC assessments are often presented as deterministic, single-point values but contain a high degree of variability which is typically unacknowledged. Common sources of uncertainty are variability, data gaps, measurement error and epistemic uncertainty such as absence of detailed material specification (e.g. manufacturer, concrete mix, recycled content etc). Particularly during early design stages when such information is unconfirmed, average material data is used by necessity. While some material databases and LCA software can provide ranges of embodied carbon coefficients (ECC) between some materials and/or the uncertainty within individual manufacturers’ carbon data, the practice of reporting this is uncommon and has limited practicality for whole building assessments. This paper presents a simple procedure that selects the highest impact materials of the EC of an asset and implements a Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the uncertainty behind the product stage EC assessment. Material coefficients of variation (CoV) are obtained from database values where available, and interpolated values are used in the absence of such data. A product stage EC assessment of a UK educational building, initially undertaken using single data points for each material, gave an EC prediction of 525 kgCO2e/m2 GIFA. Two scenarios were then assessed using our proposed procedure: 1) the full building scope and 2) substructure and superstructure only. It was demonstrated that, for scenario one, the EC can range from 50 to 140% of the original result when considering the extreme results from the Monte-Carlo simulation. Scenario one (considering the full building scope) resulted in an average EC value (mean ± CoV) of 526 kgCO2e/m2 GIFA ± 10.0%. The second scenario (sub- and super-structure only) resulted in an average EC value of 312 kgCO2e/m2 GIFA ± 11.9% with a full range of 45–155% of the original result. This paper shows that a straightforward uncertainty analysis procedure can support designers in understanding the possible range of asset product-stage EC and, therefore, inform construction product selections at an early stage where detailed information is not known. The variation also gives a degree of confidence/caution in the average EC prediction in lieu of a single-point result. The construction product CoV results can be used to set target ECCs on projects to help ensure reliable low-carbon products are specified. If these target ECCs were met, a minimum of 29% and 33% (excl. EPD uncertainty) in product stage EC reductions could be achieved. Future work should extend this method to include additional life cycle assessment (LCA) stages and other uncertainty factors. And, the method could be applied to comparative life cycle assessments and optioneering exercises, as well as including more specific construction product variability data.",Carbon mitigation | Embodied carbon | Embodied carbon coefficients | Environmental impact of buildings | LCA (life cycle assessment) | Uncertainty analysis,8,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

A range of tools have been utilised for estimating building energy use and environmental impacts; these are time-consuming and require massive data that are not necessarily available during early design stages. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an Environmental Impacts Cost Assessment Model (EICAM) that quantifies both energy and environmental costs for residential buildings. Design/methodology/approach: An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was employed to develop the EICAM. The model consists of six input parameters, including wall type, roof type, glazing type, window to wall ratio (WWR), shading device and building orientation. In addition, the model calculates four measures: annual energy cost, operational carbon over 20 years, envelope embodied carbon and total carbon per square metre. The ANN architecture is 6:13:4:4, where the conjugate gradient algorithm was applied to train the model and minimise the mean squared error (MSE). Furthermore, regression analysis for the ANN prediction for each output was performed. Findings: The MSE was minimised to 0.016 while training the model. Also, the correlation between each ANN output and the actual output was very strong, with an R2 value for each output of almost 0.998. Moreover, validation was conducted for each output, with the error percentages calculated at 0.26%, 0.25%, 0.03% and 0.27% for the annual energy cost, operational carbon, envelope materials embodied carbon and total carbon per square metre, respectively. Accordingly, the EICAM contributes to enhancing design decision-making concerning energy consumption and carbon emissions in the early design stages. Research limitations/implications: This study provides theoretical implications to the domain of building environmental impact assessment through illustrating a systematic approach for developing an energy-based prediction model that generates four environmental-oriented outputs, namely energy cost, operational energy carbon, envelope embodied carbon, and total carbon. The model developed has practical implications for the architectural/engineering (A/E) industries by providing a useful tool to easily predict environmental impact costs during the early design phase. This would enable designers in Saudi Arabia to make effective design decisions that would increase sustainability in the building life cycle. Originality/value: By providing a holistic predictive model entitled EICAM, this study endeavours to bridge the gap between energy costs and environmental impacts in a predictive model for Saudi residential units. The novelty of this model is that it is an alternative tool that quantifies both energy cost, as well as building’s environmental impact, in one model by using a machine learning approach. Besides, EICAM predicts its outcomes more quickly than conventional tools such as DesignBuilder and is reliable for predicting accurate environmental impact costs during early design stages.",Artificial neural networks | Building envelope | Embodied carbon | Energy cost | Operational carbon,6,0,,,UOD,undefined,University of Dammam

This study proposes a methodology based on life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to define a structurally equivalent functional unit for the comparison of the environmental impacts between wood-based solutions for building’s floors. The proposed methodology comprises five main steps: definition of the functional equivalence; definition of structural solutions; structural analysis; design of structural products; and calculation of the volume of structural products. This method was used to compare the environmental impacts from cradle-to-grave of structurally equivalent solutions for floors made of wood-based products with various strength and stiffness properties: solid wood (SW; softwoods and hardwoods); glued laminated timber (GLT); I-joists (IJ); and laminated veneer lumber (LVL). The results showed that, during the production stage, softwoods have the lowest environmental impact in the majority of the categories assessed. On the other hand, hardwoods (in particular D30) showed the best environmental performance during the entire life cycle. The discussion of results showed that the preliminary sizing rules have a high influence on the impacts of products with higher strength and stiffness properties.

However, these production systems caused undesirable environmental impacts. In order to move towards cleaner production in greenhouse areas, this study has assessed the potential environmental benefits and trade-offs of the integration of an on-farm reverse osmosis system powered by photovoltaic solar energy to recycle the drainage effluents from greenhouses. To that end, we compare the environmental footprint of a greenhouse tomato crop using this technology in a hydroponic system (HS), versus the conventional sanded soil ‘enarenado’ (CS) with free-drainage to soil. Additionally, for comparison, three independent irrigation sources (desalinated seawater with low electrical conductivity and two different mixes of underground and desalinated water, with moderate and high electrical conductivity, respectively) were evaluated. The use of desalinated seawater can help reduce the overexploitation of aquifers, although if the desalination process is not done with clean energy it also comes with a negative impact on the carbon footprint. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used to analyse and evaluate six environmental impact indicators associated with these production systems and water treatments. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the potential environmental benefits of increasing the use of renewable energy for desalinated water production, whilst also curbing the common over-fertilisation malpractice reported in the study area. Based on our findings, the HS with leachate treatment technology showed, compared to the CS system, a significant reduction in the eutrophication (72 %), although it did inevitably increase the depletion of fossil fuels (43 %) global warming (37 %) and acidification (32 %) impacts, due to the need for additional infrastructure and equipment. Among the inputs considered for the cultivation systems, the greenhouse structure, and the production of fertilisers and electricity for fertigation represented the highest environmental burdens. When comparing the three irrigation treatments, it was observed that the partial substitution of desalinated seawater by brackish groundwater substantially mitigated (27 %) the global warming footprint.

However, the impact of the combination of these two aspects on CO2 emissions mitigation of road life cycle is less known even though it is critical to the longer-term road transportation decarbonization and long-range policy making for transportation sector, especially under latest worldwide net-zero carbon emission goal. In this study, taking a real project-level asphalt pavement freeway with 15-year life span in China as a case, the amount and hot spots of CO2 emissions of road transportation were evaluated by considering emissions abatement measures of advanced vehicle technologies and construction supply chains which are theoretically practicable in near-, mid-term and long-term future (from 2020 to 2035). Furthermore, a scenario-based sensitivity analysis on different increasing scope together with various increasing degree of abatement levels over time for these measures is provided. Results demonstrate that the timely implementation of combined decarbonation measures of advanced vehicle technologies and construction supply chains by 2035 could reduce 16.3% of total CO2 emissions from a road life cycle. In detail, for maintenance activities and use phase, total CO2 emissions reduce 32% and 16.2% separately. The construction equipment still is the top emissions contributor for maintenance activities. The hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), not battery electric vehicles (EV), replaces conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV) and becomes the largest source for passenger-related CO2 emissions from use phase by 2035. Findings are sensitive to assumptions regarding cleaner fuel-produced cement, construction equipment and asphalt, and the market penetration of new energy vehicle. The tight and accelerating pace of primary abatements assist in alleviating the infrastructure carbon lock-in effects caused by maintenance activities with 15% additional CO2 emissions saving, but not bring about a significant additional reduction (no more than 2.0%) for total road life cycle CO2 emissions.

While Life Cycle Assessment and many environmental approaches as well as low-carbon materials are key areas of sustainable designs, optimisation methods have not been fully developed and integrated in the design process to enhance a building's sustainability. Although there are studies attempting to mitigate buildings' carbon footprints, most of them examine the major components (slab and column systems) separately, making it hard for structural engineers to apply their findings in a real project. This paper intends to address this limitation by introducing an innovative design methodology for the carbon optimisation of reinforced concrete buildings. A detailed formulation of a flat plate building's optimisation is presented, and an advanced Branch-and-Reduce deterministic algorithm is adopted to solve for minimum CO2 emissions. Compared to genetic algorithm, the proposed approach achieves a further 31% reduction in the building's embodied emissions. In this research, multiple case studies are optimised and analysed with respect to varying slab spans and numbers of stories. Overall, the optimisation algorithm performs more efficiently in buildings that are subjected to greater compressive loads, and the optimal designs tend to reduce the slab-to-column area ratio to obtain the best sustainable outcomes. Compared to the conventional designs, the optimised ones achieve 5.3–17.7% reduction in the total carbon emissions. From a correlation analysis, the column concrete strength, column size, and building's height are found to be the most significant design variables. Although the structural weight is closely related to the total embodied carbon in optimised buildings, solutions with greater material savings are not necessarily more environmentally superior. It is the balancing act between the design constraints, ratio of concrete and reinforcement consumption, and ratio of concrete and steel carbon coefficients that determines the most eco-friendly design option. Given a complex relation between design variables, a thorough optimisation problem and methodology as presented in this paper are highly effective and recommended in sustainable designs of concrete buildings. The obtained findings from the numerical applications could effectively guide structural designers towards sustainable design solutions that have the best environmental performance.",Embodied carbon | Flat plate building | Optimisation | Reinforced concrete structure | Structural design,5,0,,,,undefined,Griffith University

While the operation of buildings is fairly well regulated and globally considered in the pathways to net-zero mid-century targets, a different picture emerges when looking at the other life cycle stages, which incur the so-called embodied impacts. These cover raw material extraction and product manufacturing through to construction and end of life activities. Only a handful of examples exist where such embodied carbon (EC) emissions are enshrined in law with most of the ongoing debate still around estimating and understanding where such emissions occur and how to mitigate them. Building structures account for a significant share of a building’s embodied emissions and they also are the building element with the longest service life, thus presenting potential lock-in challenges for choices made today. To support the ongoing global effort to mitigate embodied carbon and equip engineers and designers worldwide with easy-to-use and robust calculation tools, we describe a real-time decision-support tool to aid building design that leverages machine learning (ML) methods from computer science to speed-up the computationally expensive process of finite element analysis (FEA) traditionally exploited in structural engineering. We demonstrate that replacing FEA calculations with a model learnt using ML from a large dataset offers real time decision support while guaranteeing the same level of confidence and accuracy that a traditional FEA-based method would offer at the design stage. The tool has been developed both as a standalone version and as a plugin for Trimble SketchUp to maximise its usability and diffusion. It offers results correlated with uncertainty analysis in the form of probability density functions to account for the inherent variability of input data that characterises early stages in the design process. This research contributes to the ongoing global efforts to decarbonising the built environment and offers an immediately implementable method and tool for doing so.",embodied carbon | life cycle assesment | machine learning | sketchup | sustainable buildings and cities | tools,1,1,repositoryvor,Green,RAENG,IAPP18-19\215,Royal Academy of Engineering

We compared the life cycle costs (LCC) of these alternatives to discover the lowest cost. The comparative results indicated that GLT has higher emissions in Global warming potential (GWP), Terrestrial Ecotoxicity (TE), Land Use (LUP), and Ozone layer depletion (OLD), while CLT has higher impact in Human-Toxicity Potential (HTP), Fossil Depletion Potential (FDP). The results indicated that using CLT significantly reduces embodied energy by 40%. However, a comparison of costs showed that CLT is 7% more expensive than GLT. Establishing which material performs best based on environmental and economic criteria thus required further analysis. Thus, the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method was applied. This showed that CLT manufactured with softwood is the most sustainable choice among the alternatives considered.

It is timely, therefore, that consensus is forming around a methodology for calculating embodied carbon. This encourages the inclusion of all life cycle stages, from material production and construction, through use and eventual demolition, disposal and reuse. In practice, however, end-of-life processes are fraught with uncertainty and often ignored, despite the potentially large associated carbon fluxes. Further uncertainty exists when considering bio-based construction materials, which store carbon during use. There are no widely-accepted means of accounting for timing of these carbon fluxes, despite the long service life of most buildings. Could we consider whole-life carbon in a more holistic and climate-focused way? This article uses dynamic life cycle assessment to convert greenhouse gas emission histories to key climate impacts using a simple dynamic model. The implications for structural design decisions are explored by comparing concrete, steel and timber options for a typical medium-rise building structure. Concrete is found to have a higher impact than steel, with the climate response of both options dominated by the large initial emissions of material production and construction. Timber has the smallest impact, for this example, under a typical scenario with sustainable forest management and re-emission of sequestered carbon at end-of-life. The analysis takes a forward-looking approach to sequestration, with timing corresponding to the growth of replanted trees. An optimistic timber scenario, whereby future carbon-capture technology avoids most end-of-life emissions, demonstrates the possibility of structures with small long-term climate cooling effects. Conversely, in a hypothetical worst-case scenario where no replanting or subsequent sequestration occurs, the long-term warming effect of the timber structure is increased by the net emission of biogenic carbon. Although end-of-life processes are important in the long-term, particularly for timber, the analysis also highlights the importance of the initial emissions from material production and construction. These cause high rates of short-term temperature increase and prolonged accumulation of radiative heat for all the buildings, but the impacts are again lowest for timber. Most importantly, the investigation shows how dynamic life cycle assessment can be used to explore climate impacts in a comprehensive, graphical and unbiased way. As a simple extension to established methodologies for calculating embodied carbon, it is a powerful decision making tool in the climate emergency.",Building design | Climate emergency | Embodied carbon | Life cycle assessment | Timber,28,0,repositoryam,Green,EPSRC,EP/S000771/1,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council

The green façade and the other constructive solutions were characterised by an equivalent thermal behaviour. A green façade system prototype, realised with vegetation climbing on a steel frame, was used for the study. The comparison was carried out with exterior walls using insulation materials as expanded polystyrene, expanded cork and wood fibre. A double wall with an un-ventilated air gap was used as well. On average, the best environmental performance was recorded for the wall using cork as insulating material and for the double wall. The results highlighted the environmental criticalities of the green façade as the system having an environmental load among the most burdensome. Different scenarios of green façade with the use of alternative constructive solutions were hypothesized and compared by the life cycle analysis and life cycle impact assessment. The study showed that the adoption of a wooden frame in place of the steel one, as plant supporting structure, reduces the carbon footprint of the green façade by 58%.

This study conducts a comparative study to quantitative analysis of the decarbonization potential of timber buildings from a life cycle perspective. Methods: Seven representative demonstration projects with a timber structure in China were selected as research objects. The materials inventory was collected. Based on China’s national standard Standard for Building Carbon Emission Calculation (GB/T51366-2019), the life cycle carbon emissions from all 5 stages, including production, transportation, construction, operation, and demolition stages, are calculated. The assessment results are compared to ordinary reinforced concrete buildings and ultra-low energy buildings. Results and discussion: The findings indicated that carbon emissions in the operation stage of buildings accounted for an average of 87.7% of carbon emission in the total life-cycle of buildings. Compared to ordinary buildings made of reinforced concrete, timber buildings can reduce carbon emissions in the production stage by 64.5%. Therefore, from a life-cycle perspective, 11.0% of carbon emissions can be saved. By upgrading energy efficiency to ultra-low energy buildings, although the carbon emission from building material may increase by 28.5%, the carbon emission is significantly reduced by 39.3% during the operation stage, with a 32.7% reduction for the life cycle. Conclusions: This study provides a life cycle assessment of carbon emission of 7 timber buildings in China. The timber buildings only contribute to the decarbonization for the production stage. Around 11.0% of carbon emissions can be saved for timber structures. Meanwhile, 32.7% more carbon emissions can be saved by upgrading the energy efficiency to ultra-low energy buildings.

This study presents a computational tool that automates the generation of optimal building designs in respect of their Life Cycle Carbon Footprint (LCCF) and Life Cycle Costs (LCC). This is achieved by an integration of three computational concepts: (a) A designated space-allocation generative-design application, (b) Using building geometry as a parameter in NSGA-II optimization and (c) Life Cycle performance (embodied carbon and operational carbon, through the use of thermal simulations for LCCF and LCC calculation). Examining the generation of a two-storey terrace house building, located in London, UK, the study shows that a set of building parameters combinations that resulted with a pareto front of near-optimal buildings, in terms of LCCF and LCC, could be identified by using the tool. The study shows that 80% of the optimal building’s LCCF are related to the building operational stage (σ = 2), while 77% of the building’s LCC is related to the initial capital investment (σ = 2). Analysis further suggests that space heating is the largest contributor to the building’s emissions, while it has a relatively low impact on costs. Examining the optimal building in terms compliance requirements (the building with the best operational performance), the study demonstrated how this building performs poorly in terms of Life Cycle performance.

The analysed example concerns the trolleybus transport system in Gdynia, in northern Poland, which also partially serves the neighbouring city of Sopot. In the last few years, two bus lines have been electrified with trolleybuses in the In-Motion-Charging technology, which enables operation on sections without an overhead network. Using the actual operational data, a comparative analysis of the emissivity of diesel buses and trolleybuses used on the same lines in an identical operating regime was conducted. Moreover, an attempt was made to estimate the damage costs of the emission of air pollutants for the above-mentioned means of transport. Research has shown that trolleybuses significantly help to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, non-methane volatile organic compounds and particulate matter, while increasing sulphur dioxide emissions on the served lines. They also generate lower specific emissions of carbon dioxide compared to diesel buses. However, taking into account the differences in the number of seats in these vehicles, the length of routes result-ing from a need to provide access to the necessary infrastructure and the total amount of kilometres covered on a given route, they may cause higher emissions per year and per the product life cycle than diesel buses. This is related to the unfavourable structure of energy production in Poland, which is dominated by coal sources. The research results clearly show that the use of trolleybuses in public transport contributes to a reduction of the damage costs of the emission of pollutants that amount to approximately EUR (€) 30,000–60,000 per year for the analysed lines.",CO  emission 2 | Diesel bus | Electric bus | Greenhouse gas emission | Public transport | Trolleybus,8,1,repositoryvor,Green,,2016/23/ D/HS4/03085,

However, the EPDs may vary broadly in terms of reporting and results. This study provides a comprehensive review of 81 third-party verified EN 15804 EPDs of cross laminated timber (CLT), glulam, laminated veneer lumber (LVL) and timber. The 81 EPDs represent 86 different products and 152 different product scenarios. The EPDs mainly represent European production, but also North America and Australia/New Zealand productions are represented. Reported global warming potential (GWP) from the EPDs vary within each of the investigated product categories, due to density of the products and the end-of-life scenarios applied. Median results per kg of product, excluding the biogenic CO2, are found at 0.26, 0.24, and 0.17 kg CO2e for CLT, glulam, and timber, respectively. Results further showed that the correlation between GWP and other impact categories is limited. Analysis of the inherent data uncertainty showed to add up to ±41% to reported impacts when assessed with an uncertainty method from the literature. However, in some of the average EPDs, even larger uncertainties of up to 90% for GWP are reported. Life cycle assessment practitioners can use the median values from this study as generic data in their assessments of buildings. To make the EPDs easier to use for practitioners, a more detailed coordination between EPD programs and their product category rules is recommended, as well as digitalization of EPD data.",Biogenic CO 2 | Building design | Carbon footprint | EN 15804 | Environmental product declaration | Life cycle assessment | Material choice | Structural wood,12,1,repositoryvor,Green,,00029207,Villum Fonden

Building models have been designed in accordance with building codes, in terms of seismic and energy savings criteria. In addition, residential (RB) and non-residential (NRB) uses have been also considered for calculations. IWs had in all cases similar equivalent thermal transmittance, achieved by varying the air gap length between layers in order to establish a common comparative framework. Otherwise, IWs showed a different thermal capacity depending on used material within the wall construction. The analysis concluded that the mechanical behavior was similar in all cases, regardless the excess of weight added by adobes. Besides, in low height buildings the increasing of stiffness possesses an advantage for lateral loads resistance. In addition, by using adobe with ashes, 5% of equivalent CO2 footprint (i.e. from cradle to gate) and 4% of energy consumption may be saved. These savings must be even lower when the entire life cycle is considered, since adobes may be easily collected and reused without any treatments while fired clay bricks require further treatments.",Adobe | Brick | Energy | Shear wall | Waste,2,0,,,CONICYT,REGULAR 1180414,Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica

In this context, this study compares the life cycle emissions of a new steel-bamboo composite frame structure with a general reinforced concrete frame structure associated with a rural detached house in East China. Based on the inventory analysis of the production, construction, operation, and end of life phases, a process-based method is adopted to assess the emissions and a Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to investigate the influences of parameter uncertainty on the comparison. The results show that life cycle emissions of the steel-bamboo and concrete frame structures are 440.6 tCO2e and 537.4 tCO2e, respectively. Although the operation phase is the largest contributor, the production phase accounts for up to 36.4% of the total emissions. The contribution coefficients of desired processes indicate that cooling, heating, and lighting are influencing factors for the emissions of both structural schemes, whereas production of galvanized steel sheet and bamboo scrimber should be underlined to reduce emissions from the steel-bamboo structure. Based on an uncertainty analysis using 10000 simulation iterations, the 95% confidence interval of emission reduction in the steel-bamboo structure is estimated as [21.0, 155.0] tCO2e. this result verifies that the steel-bamboo structure is more “carbon-friendly” than a general concrete frame structure.

This paper presents the environmental benefits of using miscanthus shives in lightweight blocks and their potential application in wall assemblies. A systemic life cycle assessment (LCA) is carried out for miscanthus-lime blocks, and the effects of binder type and binder content are discussed. The environmental performance-based analysis reveals that miscanthus blocks can capture 135 kg CO2eq/m3 for an assumed 100-years life period. The impact analysis using the University of Leiden, institute of environmental science (CML) baseline (v4.4) method shows that 75% of the greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to the production of mineral binders. A reduction of binder to aggregate ratio from 2.0 to 1.5 reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 32.9%. The use of 10 wt% mineral additions can potentially stabilise blocks while having little effect on their overall environmental impacts. The environmental profiles of wall systems incorporating miscanthus-lime blocks have been evaluated in this this study. Combining miscanthus blocks with fired clay bricks enables a potential low carbon retrofitting technique for the current stock of residential buildings in the UK. Timber-framed system filled with miscanthus blocks enables a carbon storage of ~97.3 kg CO2eq/m2, which presents a potential carbon offsetting strategy in new-build dwellings. Consideration should be given to the potential negative impacts related to agricultural activities for the production of miscanthus shives. The largest negative environmental impact was ozone layer depletion, where a relative difference of 12.8% was recorded between miscanthus timber-framed wall and a typical solid wall insulated with mineral wool.

One of the key elements for greenhouse building-integrated agriculture (BIA) and CA to achieve high levels of environmental performance is their structural design, which largely impacts the economic and environmental life-cycle costs (by up to 63%). In this context, the study assessed iRTGs life-cycle material and energy flows and their environmental burdens at structural level (m-2y-1) within life cycle assessment (LCA), based on a case study in Barcelona. A structural assessment following European standards allowed the identification of key design factors to minimize the environmental impacts of RTGs’ structure within improvement scenarios.

The key design factors responsible for these environmental impacts were ground height, ventilation design, building integration and urban location. The improvement scenarios compensated for additional steel inputs by up to 35.9% and decreased environmental impacts that might occur in the BIA context by 24.1% compared with the BAU scenario.

The first objective is to create a benchmark the environmental impact of buildings. The second objective is to develop a procedural guideline that assists practitioners in decreasing the environmental impact of buildings. To achieve these objectives, a systematic review of the relevant literature was conducted to categorize and summarize relevant studies. A meta-analysis followed to synthesize the life cycle assessment results that emerged from the collected articles. The articles were categorized into two main groups: articles on construction materials and articles on entire buildings. Eight construction materials (i.e., concrete, reinforcement bars, structural steel, timber, tiles, insulation, and plaster) and three building types (i.e., concrete, timber, and steel) were identified, and related embodied energy and carbon were extracted. Subsequently, the data were analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings from the meta-analysis informed a regression model, which in turn informed a procedural guideline for practitioners who seek to reduce buildings' environmental impact. Further, the findings of this paper shed light on previously equivocal results concerning the impact of construction materials and buildings, but also support previous findings for structural materials, showing, for example, that the use of timber structures results in substantial savings over concrete structures in terms of both embodied energy (43%) and carbon (68%).",Buildings | Construction material | Embodied carbon | Embodied energy | Life cycle assessment | Meta-analysis | Systematic literature review,40,0,,,ARC,IC150 1000 23,Australian Research Council

Reasons for ignoring uncertainty include resource constraints or a lack of knowledge or expertise. This paper presents a structured uncertainty management method that aims to improve uncertainty reporting in LCA. Methods: The most common uncertainty classification for LCA is parameter, model and scenario; however, multiple classifications exist in literature. The latest classification published by Igos et al. (2019) divides uncertainty into three dimensions: location, level and nature, based on previous research (Walker et al. 2003; Warmink et al. 2010). In this paper, the three-dimensional uncertainty classification is further developed for practical implementation in LCA. The classification is incorporated into an uncertainty management methodology that is divided into five steps: identification, classification, quantification or qualification, reduction and reporting, and is integrated into the iterative steps of an LCA in accordance with ISO 14044 (2006). The method is demonstrated in a tiered-hybrid case study of an Irish apartment development from cradle-to-gate that focuses on climate change. The data sources include the bill of quantities, Ecoinvent datasets, Irish input-output tables and Irish environmental accounts data. Results and discussion: The initial uncertainty assessment of the case study found that the deterministic value likely underestimates the total tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (t CO2-eq.) for the apartment development. The probability that the impact is greater than the deterministic value is approximately 93%, prior to uncertainty reduction. The main contributors to the total uncertainty were identified as the choice of Ecoinvent dataset, the sectoral emission intensities and the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change Global Warming Potentials. Therefore, work to reduce the total uncertainty should focus on identifying the most suitable dataset for the building material to reduce the input distribution for that material and on acquiring more product-specific data. Conclusions and recommendations: The developed uncertainty management method improves the way uncertainty is managed in practice in LCA case studies by providing a detailed and structured way for uncertainty to be identified, classified, measured and reported. It further identifies where resources can be focused to iteratively reduce the overall uncertainty of the results and thus improve their reliability. It is recommended that the developed method is tested across other case studies, life cycle stages and impact categories in further work.",Buildings and construction | Life cycle assessment | Monte Carlo analysis | Sensitivity analysis | Uncertainty classification | Uncertainty management | Uncertainty ranking | Uncertainty reduction,0,0,,,,undefined,

Despite many studies have been prompted to analyze buildings’ embodied carbon, reported results display large unjustifiable variations, whereas the different variables have seldom been examined systematically. This study aims to investigate how embodied carbon assessment is affected by different variables and what the exact numerical influences are. A framework is first established to examine variables in four methodological dimensions, i.e. temporal differences, spatial disparities, procedural inconsistencies, and physical diversities. Then, using this framework, a three-step normalization is conducted to minimize the discrepancies in different variables among 244 cases studies published between 2000 and 2020 to ensure they can be compared on the same scale. Eleven variables affecting the results are identified. After the normalization, the average embodied carbon in the manufacturing, transportation, and construction stages decreases significantly (to 443 kg CO2e/m2) compared with the initial samples (513 kg CO2e/m2). Remarkable variations in the assessment results are seen as a result of changes in modeling approaches (e.g. 200% increases from process-based to hybrid method), emission factor databases (e.g. 282% for steels in ICE) and building structures (e.g. 166 kg CO2e/m2 for concrete and timber buildings). The study provides a theoretical foundation, using eleven variables, for explaining variations in the reported carbon of different buildings, which better facilitates cross-case comparisons and benchmarking in future studies. The variables that exert the most influence are quantitatively identified following the three-step normalization, bridging the gap where only qualitative analysis was previously conducted.",Carbon emission | Embodied carbon | Life cycle assessment | Life cycle carbon assessment,11,0,,,,17203219,

BIM can be utilized to integrate the calculation of Embodied Energy (EE) Building Materials with the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) method. EE calculation could be easier for architects; hence, the architects can understand the impact of carbon emissions caused by construction activities during the design process. This paper aims to provide an overview of the use of BIM in calculating the EE value of the designed building material on the apartment project. Since the development and construction of flats and apartments, especially in Indonesia, are growing fast, this will give highly environmental impact if it is not properly controlled. The results showed that the BIM implementation in calculating the EE value could be done. Collaboration with other platforms can also be done to make the final calculation, and it will be displayed in attractive data visualizations. The percentage comparison of the embodied energy value in all of the building component materials can also be seen in the results of the analysis. In this case, the highest embodied energy percentage is the structural component, which is 53.16%. It is hoped that the development of this calculation method will contribute to the development of LCA so that EE can be easy to be calculated and have a good impact on the construction industry in the future, especially in Indonesia.",BIM | Design Phase | Embodied Energy | LCA | Residential Building,0,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,,undefined,

As a result, the government and researchers have gradually begun to attach great importance to the industrialization of low-carbon and energy-saving buildings. The rise of prefabricated buildings has promoted a major transformation of the construction methods in the construction industry, which is conducive to reducing the consumption of resources and energy, and of great significance in promoting the lowcarbon emission reduction of industrial buildings. This article mainly studies the calculation model for carbon emissions of the three-stage life cycle of component production, logistics transportation, and on-site installation in the whole construction process of composite beams for prefabricated buildings. The construction of CG-2 composite beams in Fujian province, China, was taken as the example. Based on the life cycle assessment method, carbon emissions from the actual construction process of composite beams were evaluated, and that generated by the composite beam components during the transportation stage by using diesel, gasoline, and electric energy consumption methods were compared in detail. The results show that (1) the carbon emissions generated by composite beams during the production stage were relatively high, accounting for 80.8% of the total carbon emissions, while during the transport stage and installation stage, they only accounted for 7.6% and 11.6%, respectively; and (2) during the transportation stage with three different energy-consuming trucks, the carbon emissions from diesel fuel trucks were higher, reaching 186.05 kg, followed by gasoline trucks, which generated about 115.68 kg; electric trucks produced the lowest, only 12.24 kg.",Carbon emission | Carbon emission reduction | Composite beam | Construction process | Life cycle assessment method,5,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,undefined,

While a body of research exists into such emissions, a systematic comparison of multiple building structures in steel, concrete, and timber alternatives is missing. In this article, comparisons are made between mass and whole-life embodied carbon (WLEC) emissions of building superstructures using identical frame configurations in steel, reinforced concrete, and engineered timber frames. These are assessed and compared for 127 different frame configurations, from 2 to 19 stories. Embodied carbon coefficients for each material and life cycle stage are represented by probability density functions to capture the uncertainty inherent in life cycle assessment. Normalized results show clear differences between the masses of the three structural typologies, with the concrete frame approximately five times the mass of the timber frame, and 50% higher than the steel frame. The WLEC emissions are mainly governed by the upfront emissions (cradle to practical completion), but subsequent emissions are still significant—particularly in the case of timber for which 36% of emissions, on average, occur post-construction. Results for WLEC are more closely grouped than for masses, with median values for the timber frame, concrete frame, and steel frame of 119, 185, and 228 kgCO2e/m2, respectively. Despite the advantage for timber in this comparison, there is overlap between the results distributions, meaning that close attention to efficient design and procurement is essential.

The framework uses Pareto Principles to identify the primary contributors to these metrics, proposes alternative design strategies and uses Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACC) to visualise direct and indirect impacts of the changes. The framework is tested on an 18-storey building in Sydney. Results show that embodied carbon makes up 27–58% of the building's total lifecycle carbon emissions, depending on the future energy mix. The most significant contributor to embodied carbon and capital cost is the structural system. Alternative structural systems are evaluated with a post-tensioned concrete structure demonstrating an 8% reduction in embodied carbon and a 10% capital cost saving.

The embodied impact is traditionally assessed through a deterministic lifecycle assessment (LCA) approach whose validity is impaired by existing uncertainties in the building lifecycle, so that uncertainty analyses are necessary to improve the validity of buildings LCAs. However, there are many limitations in current uncertainty studies such as biases in the use of a pure data quality indicator (DQI) approach, a lack of uncertainty analyses for lifecycle phases such as the end-of-life stage, and the incomprehensiveness in uncertainty parameters. To address these gaps, this study: (i) proposed a tier-hybrid uncertainty assessment approach to evaluate parameter uncertainties in the lifecycle of buildings; (ii) adopted proper assumptions to explore the impact of scenario and model uncertainties as well as investigate strategies to reduce the energy use and carbon emission. A case study is conducted to estimate uncertainties in building LCAs where end-of-life management strategies and alternative design materials are comprehensively explored to reduce energy and environmental impacts. It is revealed that the materials production stage causes the least uncertainties although it contributes the most impacts. Uncertainties in other lifecycle phases reduce in the order of transportation, maintenance to construction. Also, it is proved that the alternative design strategies and materials explored can effectively reduce the energy use and carbon emission by 19.91% and 15.23%, respectively.

However, none of the previous studies have quantified the energy reduction and their environmental impacts simultaneously for these passive design parameters to achieve the national standard requirements for house rating. Hence, this study focuses on the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM-Autodesk Revit), energy rating tool (FirstRate5), and BIM-enabled life cycle assessment (LCA-Tally) to quantify, compare, and improve the building design options to reduce carbon footprint and energy consumptions in residential dwellings. Sensitivity analysis has been performed with the @Risk Palisade decision tool for optimizing operational energy efficiency. The sensitivity indices show the ceiling (0.84–0.96) and the wall (0.22–0.37) are the most influential predictors for passive design strategies to reduce energy consumption. A moderate correlation exists with windows, floors, and orientations (0.13–0.29), where the relationship with eave projection, air infiltrations is relatively weak. BIM has been used as a platform of interconnectivity between optimized operational energy of @Risk optimizer and consequent embodied phases. A comparative study of insulation performance identifies that 95% of the ceiling's total operational energy consumption can be minimized using R3 rather than R6 of the national thermal code. For the wall, 90% of energy minimization can occur using R2 rather than R4 of the national thermal code. The study reveals that while insulation is only 1% of the total building mass, and the corresponding carbon footprint and primary energy demand are 4% and 7%, respectively, LCA explains a significant amount of energy, about 76% reduction at its operational stage.

This is to be achieved through the reuse of existing materials and structures, selection of lower-carbon materials purchased from local sources, installation of renewable energy systems, natural lighting and improved thermal insulation of the building's envelope, as well as developing a carbon offset strategy. The heritage designation of the building imposed restrictions on the design of the project (e.g., preventing insulation of exterior walls). In collaboration with the owner and constructor, the project team completed a life cycle assessment (LCA) consisting of an assessment of embodied emissions of the building's restoration from cradle to grave, accompanied by a scoping estimate of greenhouse gas emissions associated with its future operational energy use. Primary construction data for the newly-added materials, transport, and construction activities were used. Life cycle inventory analysis and impact assessment were implemented in the One Click LCA software. Use phase carbon intensity was estimated using design and literature data. In addition to the ‘core and shell’ LCA scope typically applied to buildings, the team also tracked materials and processes that are often not included in building LCA studies such as HVAC, plumbing, and renewable energy systems. Embodied carbon for the restoration project, assuming a 60-year lifetime, is calculated as 1250 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). Sixty-nine percent of the carbon comes from the materials (extraction to manufacturing) used in construction, 20% is due to replacement of materials during the building's service life, and most of the remaining 11% is from on-site construction energy (5%) and waste disposal at end-of-life (4%). The main building elements contributing to the embodied carbon are the renewable energy systems (31%) and the raised concrete floor (26%). Building envelope and foundation play minor roles, as they are mostly pre-existing. The embodied carbon added to the building through the restoration project is forecast to be balanced by savings in operational energy related to heating, cooling and lighting, within 3–13 years, depending on whether natural gas or electricity use are avoided, respectively. Uncertainties in the analysis arise from partial or missing data, modeling assumptions and future scenario unknowns. The model is sensitive to the useable lifetime of the building, local or non-local sourcing of building materials, modeling of certain components used in large quantities, and changes in the recycled content of steel. This study of a net zero carbon refurbishment project of a heritage building provides insights for assessments of future projects as such refurbishments become more commonplace. The methods and recommendations regarding data sources, data collection, and approach to uncertainty evaluation will be useful for LCA of any construction project.",Data collection | Embodied carbon | LCA | Net zero carbon | Refurbishment | Sensitivity analysis,32,0,,,OCE,27943,BASF

However, previous studies often failed to assess the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the urban precincts comprehensively and reliably due to methodological and data-related limitations. This study is conceived to bridge this gap by applying a case-specific hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) to a typical residential precinct including buildings, open spaces, network, on-site energy units and occupant-related mobility. Meanwhile, the corresponding conventional process-based LCA is conducted alongside to quantify the impact of applying different LCA approaches. For the whole precinct, the life cycle GHG emissions from hybrid LCA is 16% higher than its corresponding process-based LCA result, reaching 16.6 t CO2e/inhabitant/year. Embodied emissions, operational emissions and occupant-related transport emissions take up 28%, 32% and 40% of the life cycle GHG emissions, respectively, and the biggest difference between these two LCA approaches is seen in embodied emissions (22%), followed by transport emissions (17%) and operational emissions (11%). Assuming no technology innovation and substantial changes in economic structure, precinct design and lifestyle are involved, twelve GHG emissions mitigation measures are quantified. While process-based LCA suggests a mitigation potential of 35%, hybrid LCA results in a reduction of 31%. The most effective measures are related to reducing transport emissions and operational emissions, but for the embodied emissions, instead of reducing them, the combination of all measures brings about a slight increase both absolutely and relatively. From base case to mitigated case, the differences between two LCA approaches are enlarged and the biggest difference is always seen in embodied emission. This implies the process-based LCA would further underestimate the life cycle GHG emissions in mitigated case, therefore, the use of hybrid LCA is more favourable for the purpose of providing a comprehensive and reliable assessment.",Australia | Embodied emissions | Hybrid life cycle assessment | Operational emissions | Precinct | Transport emissions,7,0,,,ARC,LE160100066,Australian Research Council

Widely considered a hard-to-decarbonise sector, improvements in buildings and construction are of fundamental importance for national and global targets to combat climate change. At material level, mitigation opportunities exist in terms of efficiency (using less of the same material) and substitution (using a different material). This article investigates the latter, with a global focus on the use of cross laminated timber to replace concrete floors in steel structural systems. This approach, whilst innovative, does not require any technological development nor upskilling of current professional practice, thus making it an immediately viable solution to accelerate decarbonisation. We combine Material Flow Analysis with Life Cycle Assessment across both spatial and temporal dimensions, accounting for different levels of uptake of the proposed hybrid construction in the next 30 years. Results show that greenhouse gas emissions saving potentials range between 20 and 80 Mt CO2e (95% confidence interval) with an average around 50 Mt CO2e in the case of full uptake of the hybrid construction system by 2050. Our analysis does not account for carbon sequestration potential in timber, which would make the savings much greater. Still, the overall savings represent a 1.5% reduction of the annual greenhouse gas emissions generally attributed to construction, thus making it a non-trivial contribution to progress towards global targets of net-zero carbon buildings.",Buildings | Carbon | Design | Frame | Mass | Structures,43,0,repositoryam,Green,EPSRC,R01468X/1,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council

As design movements became global and mechanical systems evolved to provide ready access to heating and cooling, buildings became less climate responsive and more energy intensive to operate. Architecture of this time also celebrated structural innovation and novel materials, which led to frequent integration of structure, envelope, and systems. These characteristics resulted in a building stock with typically poor energy efficiency and new material challenges for conservation. Rather than a justification to tear down these buildings and replace them, their vast numbers and significant contributions to global greenhouse gas emissions are reasons why mid-century buildings must be effectively repurposed to meet climate goals while respecting their history. With the imperative to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius, reusing and upgrading these buildings provides a critical near-term carbon reduction strategy. This paper presents two case studies involving the reuse of undergraduate residence halls of this era. The first illustrates the substantial total carbon savings from restoration and reuse.

Technical scientific and economic tools, including life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost assessment (LCCA) with an integrated framework from a Malaysian case study were applied to similar climatic regions, Thailand, and Indonesia. The short-term, future scaled-up scenario was defined using a proxy technology and estimated data. Environmental locations for this scenario were identified, the environmental impacts were compared, and the techno-economic output were analysed. The scope of this study is cradle-to-grave. Levelised cost of energy (LCOE) was greatly affected due to PV performance degradation rate, especially the critical shading issues for large-scale installations. Despite the land use impact, increased CO2 emissions accumulate over time with regard to energy mix of the country, which requires the need for long-term procurement of both carbon and investment return. With regards to profitably, grid-connected roof-mounted systems achieve the lowest LCOE as compared to other types of installation, ranging from 0.0491 USD/kWh to 0.0605 USD/kWh under a 6% discounted rate. A simple payback (SPB) time between 7–10 years on average depends on annual power generated by the system with estimated energy payback of 0.40–0.55 years for common polycrystalline photovoltaic technology. Thus, maintaining the whole system by ensuring a low degradation rate of 0.2% over a long period of time is essential to generate benefits for both investors and the environment.

To achieve climate targets by 2050, all operational emissions need to be phased out along with reductions in embodied carbon. This paper aims to analyze the carbon life cycle (LCA) of the case study building in the UK. Further implementing low carbon & clean technologies have been considered to reduce the embodied and operational carbon. Current state of the art carbon assessment is utilized incorporating methodologies such as ‘Cradle to grave’ from ‘British standards’ in conjunction with ‘RICS Guidance note’ and ‘RICS Professional statement.’ To measure the embodied and operational carbon using the ‘cradle to grave’ process, requires selecting a case study building and collecting related input data to process calculations such as construction materials and energy consumption. Results conclude that the operational stage is the largest CO₂ contributor of the whole lifecycle, therefore PV Solar panels were chosen to reduce CO₂ emissions. The product stage was the second most significant CO₂ contributor therefore low carbon strategies, such as use of recycled steel, light weight brick, and SCM’s for mortar and concrete, were selected. Re-calculation of the embodied and operational carbon of the building after implementing the low carbon strategies and clean technology comparing to initial results show reductions in CO₂ emissions by 22% creating a low carbon building.

To this end, this paper offers a uniform method by describing current work, quantifying material weights and finally calculating embodied carbon dioxide ranges. The approach is cradle-to-gate but can be expanded to cradle-to-grave. The survey contains data on 200 recently completed buildings obtained from industry. The results show that structural material quantities vary between 200 kg/m2 and 1800 kg/m2 and embodied carbon dioxide caries on the range 150-600 kgCO2e/m2. These numbers are analysed by programme type, structural system, size, number of floors and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (Leed) certification. In doing so, the paper emphasises the important role that structural engineers play in sustainability.",buildings | environment | structures &amp; design | sustainability,7,0,,,,undefined,

Although the sustainable effect of the reuse of materials has been proven in several studies, materials are not always reused in practice, owing to the lack of an information system for reusable materials and the economic uncertainty. In this study, we propose a framework for designing structures using reusable steel beams. The design framework consists of a material bank and a design support tool.

The extensive and increasing usage of conventional concrete, mortar, plasters and various cement-based materials is only one of the many factors contributing towards urban thermal discomfort caused by urban heat island phenomena and the poor thermal insulation of ordinary cement mortar. Not only this, the wide use of concrete and mortar in construction increases the consumption of their primary components mainly -Portland cement-requiring a large consumption of energy and causing a significant rise in CO2 emissions. Embedding natural and artificial cementitious/pozzolana materials in today's cement-based building materials has become a common practice. Cementitious and Pozzolanic materials are known to provide an added value to mortar/concrete not only in terms of mechanical and durability properties but also in energy efficiency and enhancing sustainability. Sarooj is a local term describing an artificial cementitious and pozzolana material obtained by traditional calcining of the raw clayey soil. Although its usage is nowadays very limited, Sarooj has been used in Oman and other neighboring countries for centuries, in various buildings and defense structures. The main objective of this research is to transform the traditionally produced Sarooj into an engineered binding material and hence investigating its physico-mechanical and thermal properties. The raw soil used to produce the traditional Sarooj was employed to engineer a modern “Sarooj” under controlled energy processing (grinding and calcination) conditions. The raw clay minded from specific location was ground first to a fine powdered material and then subjected to full characterization. The physical and chemical characterization indicated that the raw soil is suitable for producing a cementitious/pozzolanic calcined clay. The thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis of the clay used reveal that only a moderate temperature of around 800 °C is required for its calcination which preserves energy and reduces CO2 emissions compared to 1600 °C to produce clinker cement. The strength development showed a slow early-age reactivity but an appreciable enhancement in long-term which demonstrates a remarkable latent hydraulic potential of the clay used. It was also found that adding an optimum amount of the calcined clay enhances the thermal properties. The annual energy performance of a typical housing in the hot climate of Muscat, Oman, was evaluated using DesignBuilder software, a whole-building simulation tool. The simulation results showed insignificant savings in annual energy consumption when the developed mixes are used as plastering materials. The clay alkali-activated with NaOH has, however, showed great potential to enhance the mortar's long-term strength. Using locally engineered cementitious material in a partial replacement of Portland cement can further enhance durability and sustainability by reducing the manufacturing energy of the produced building material such as mortars and plasters.",Calcination | Chemical composition | Clay | Compressive strength | Energy | Portland cement | Sarooj | Thermal properties,8,0,,,SQU,undefined,Sultan Qaboos University

We examine the impact of vehicle bans on life cycle GHG emissions and on the marginal cost (MC) of emissions reduction using four different scenarios defined by hydrogen production method, renewable energy share, and infrastructure development for refueling stations. The vehicle penetration and the fuel demand are determined by a consumer choice model characterized by a multinomial logit algorithm. Our analysis found that vehicle bans significantly promote battery electric vehicles (BEVs) for mini-sized vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) for light and heavy-duty vehicles. A vehicle ban that excludes BEVs and FCVs from 2035 under an enhanced infrastructure plan can reduce the life cycle GHG emissions as much as 438 million tonnes by 2060 compared to the 2017 level. The MC of the life cycle GHG mitigation decreases continuously and reaches as low as $482 per tonne CO2eq in 2060. However, if PHEVs are excluded from the ban, the life cycle GHG emissions are reduced more by 88 Mt-CO2eq in 2060 at a lower MC of $122 per tonne CO2eq. This is due to decreases in GHG emissions from VP where the replacement of PHEVs for BEVs and FCVs reduces the production of batteries and fuel cells.

A key stage in such a shift is to be able to quantify stocks of construction materials and assess their direct reuse potential as products against criteria such as their location, age, type, and embodied carbon. The majority of studies of building stocks have focused on producing aggregated quantities of materials, regardless of the required information for assessing the potential value streams of future reuse.

The results obtained demonstrated that, for both alternatives, in terms of environmental LCA of the production, the stage of raw materials extraction (A1) is the most influential for all the studied environmental impact categories. By comparing the two alternatives, it was found that the second panel (hybrid sandwich panel) presents the highest environmental impact. More specifically, the results obtained show that the use of SFRMC for the top skin and of carbon fibres significantly increases the environmental impact of the product. Furthermore, an economic comparison of the production showed that the hybrid panel is a more expensive alternative as well. It was found that panel a1 is better than panel b1 because, in addition to the lower cost (the production cost of the latter is 24% higher than that of panel a1), it is also more environmentally friendly at the production stage (impacts of panel b1 are between 3% and 27% higher than panel a1 in categories PE-NRe, PE-Re, ADP, GWP and EP, while the latter presents impacts between 2% and 10% higher than panel b1 in categories POCP, AP and ODP).

The subject of analysis is a set of five buildings erected within the same constrictions in terms of floor area, energy performance and construction costs. The tested design strategies were: use of recycled materials, design for extended durability of components, adaptable design, and design for reduction of operational energy demand. The results of the five buildings are compared with a reference building (i.e. a typical, Danish single-family dwelling). Results show that the recycling/upcycling strategy is the most effective in reducing the embodied carbon. The use of structural wood in the same design furthermore points to the use of wood as a viable low-carbon strategy. In combination, these two strategies result in an approximate 40% saving of life cycle embodied carbon compared to the reference. Using durable materials yields up to 30% lower embodied carbon compared to the reference, whereas a design for adaptability results in 17% lower embodied carbon. However, these results are sensitive to the scenarios made for the service lives of materials and the implemented disassembly solutions. In a life cycle carbon perspective, the emissions from energy use prove to be of importance, although depending on the modelling approaches of the energy mix.

The carbon emissions of different forms of air-conditioning cold sources are different. Among them, the second option is the direct-fired lithium bromide absorption chiller and hot water unit. The carbon emissions are related to the energy structure. For prefabricated buildings, the proportion of carbon emissions in the construction use phase is the highest, reaching 75%–80%, and the sum of the construction use phase and the building material production phase accounts for more than 90% of the total.",Building life cycle | Carbon emission model | Energy management | Life cycle assessment (LCA),19,0,,,,K1910105,Provincial Foundation for Excellent Young Talents of Colleges and Universities of Anhui Province

A narrative literature review was carried out to provide a comprehensive overview as well as to highlight the recent contributions related to the environmental evaluation of high-rise and low-rise buildings. The study was carried out by searching the databases of the Scopus and Elsevier in conjunction with ScienceDirect and Google Scholar databases. The reason for this was to cover the published papers in this field up to the highest degree of accuracy. By means of the search of publications quoting the use of LCA in construction sector for the period from 1997 to 2018, more than 230 peer-reviewed publications referencing the use of life cycle assessment in buildings have been identified. The review shows that low-rise buildings (1~5 floors) compared to high-rise ones (≥ 5 floors) received significant attention as the studies focusing on the life cycle assessment of low-rise buildings were about twice in number more than the studies related to the life cycle assessment of high-rise buildings. In case of high-rise buildings, commercial buildings gained more attention by over 60% of the reviewed studies, while for low-rise buildings, residential buildings took the leverage by accounting to over 70% of the reviewed studies. The more frequently studied life cycle stages were those related to the manufacturing and use phases. Similarly, the most considered impact categories were the global warming potential and embodied energy. The reported values for embodied energy of high-rise buildings had a great variation ranging from 0.533 MJ/m2 to 883.1 GJ/m2, while the same values for low-rise buildings ranged from 0.21 to 374.4 GJ/m2. In terms of global warming potential, high-rise buildings emitted 10 to 10,010 kg CO2-eq/m2 per year, however, some studies revealed the potential of timber structure in emission reduction by values ranging from 234.8 to 1338 kg CO2-eq/m2. The emissions associated by low-rise buildings ranged from 0.07 to 35,765 kg CO2-eq/m2, and the respective values for emission reduction by timber structures were between 12.9 and 361 kg CO2-eq/m2. The results also indicate that a wide range of building's lifespan varying from 20 to over 100 years were utilized in life cycle assessment of different types of buildings. Functional unit was also another parameter that showed a broad variation both in terms of unit and definition. While the majority of researchers considered “m2” as the functional unit (61%), “whole building” was also considered as the functional unit in almost 20% of the reviewed studies, indicating the lack of standardized definition for functional unit for more practical outcomes. Ecoinvent was the most referred inventory database (65%) for life cycle assessment of buildings followed by University of Bath ICE (11%), U.S. database (9%), and Australian material inventory database (7%). SimaPro dominated computer-aided softwares with 40% of citations among the reviewed studies. ATHENA Impact Estimator and GaBi software gathered the attention of the reviewed studies by 7.5% and 4%, respectively. The review finally highlights that the variations in building design (structure and materials), lifetime, functional unit, and scope restrict to compare the findings and results of studies with each other.",Building sector | Construction process | Embodied energy | Life cycle assessment | Life cycle inventory,78,0,,,,undefined,Türkiye Bilimler Akademisi

Eight buildings with different material selections ranging from wood-constructions to wood-concrete hybrid constructions and concrete constructions with different energy standards are environmentally assessed. Results show that about 12.5 million kg of CO2 are stored in the wooden structures over the estimated life cycle of 50 years within this neighborhood.

The main drawback of this linear economy consists in the accumulation of empty containers in import-based countries. Designers throughout the world are working with intermodal containers for environmental purposes, often employing them as building components. This research aims to evaluate the environmental impact of a container dwelling in comparison with similar steel and X-Lam structures. Method: In order to estimate the effective sustainability of container structures, a comparative LCA has been undertaken. A cut-off approach was adopted focusing on Global Warming Potential (GWP), Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP), Acidification Potential (AP) and Eutrophication Potential (EP). To ensure reliable comparisons, a functional unit with combined spatial and thermal requirements has been defined. The proposed unit includes a total floor surface of 206.6 m2 and transmittance requirements in accordance with IECC standards. Three scenarios have been identified to address cold, temperate and hot climates within import-oriented places: Vancouver, Durban and Chennai. For hot climates the functional unit has been implemented with a minimum Periodic Thermal Transmittance. Results and discussion: It can be generally stated that the use of shipping containers as building components leads to overall environmental benefits compared to steel and X-Lam structures within the boundaries of this analysis. The main advantages of container structures are related to easy reclaim of structural materials, creative reuse and shorter construction schedules. While the use of containers as building components demonstrated the best environmental advantages for cold climates, those benefits can be overturned by improper choices of thermal masses for hot and temperate climates. Conclusions: Empty containers are accumulated worldwide as a result of the linear nature of the trading system. With an upcycling process, the “stored” steel contained within abandoned freight containers is introduced into the circular economy of the building sector. Therefore, shipping containers can be regarded as waste objects that can be used as building components thus avoiding the use of steel from other processes or the extraction of virgin materials during the product stage. This upcycling process provides for each 200-m2 new house a general global warming potential reduction ranging from 20 to 25 tons of CO2 equivalent compared to steel frames and 10 to 26 tons reduction compared to x-lam structures in cold and hot climates, while resulting in an increment of + 3 tons in a temperate scenario.",Comparative LCA | Environmental advantage | Functional unit | Shipping containers | Steel | Upcycling | X-Lam,7,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Design/methodology/approach: The present study uses a three-step (bottom-up) process-based life cycle analysis of the construction material set for two different apartment units. The current study uses material analysis. Embodied CO2 is estimated by multiplying material masses with the corresponding ECO2 coefficients (kg CO2/kg). Due to the lack of a comprehensive Kosovo database, data from an international database are utilized. The results provide practical baseline indicators for the contribution of each material in terms of mass and embodied CO2. Findings: Results of quantitative research find that apartment unit representative of the old communist-era construction produces 50 percent more embodied CO2 emissions than an apartment unit that is representative of modern construction in Kosovo. The study finds that this difference comes mainly because of the utilization of larger quantities of steel, concrete, and precast fabricated concrete in the apartment unit that is representative of the old communist era. Research limitations/implications: The calculation of embodied CO2 emissions for major construction materials in typical apartments in Kosovo can help in the development of national databases in the future. The availability of such databases could help the construction industry in Kosovo to open up to new sustainable design approaches since such databases and evaluations performed in the national context in Kosovo could help the builders in selecting, assessing and using environmentally friendly materials during the design or refurbishment stage of a building.

However, no studies have evaluated the environmental impact of the construction of CLT buildings in Japan. This study evaluates the environmental impacts from the start of construction to the completion of a real CLT building in Kumamoto city, Kyushu region, southern Japan. We investigated the input of the materials and energy used in the construction of the building. The environmental impact categories evaluated include climate change, ozone layer depletion, eutrophication, acidification, and photochemical oxidation. We found that the concrete used for the foundations, and the cement-based soil stabilizer used for ground reinforcement accounted for 42% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The construction site was previously used as a seedbed field, necessitating ground reinforcement. Furthermore, the large foundations were designed in order to raise the low height of the wooden structure from the ground level. Developing and applying methods with lower environmental impacts for ground reinforcement and building foundations is recommended. In addition, we found that by using biomass-derived electricity in CLT manufacturing, the environmental impacts of CLT manufacturing could be reduced, thus reducing the environmental impacts of the entire building. The biogenic carbon fixed in the wooden parts during the building usage accounted for 32% of the total GHG emissions of the building construction. Since this biogenic carbon will be released to the atmosphere at the end-of-life stage of the building, a long-term usage of the CLT buildings and/or reuse of the CLT is recommended.",Biogenic carbon | Construction | Cradle-to-installation | Cross-laminated timber (CLT) | Environmentally conscious design | Life cycle assessment (LCA) | Wooden building,10,1,repositoryvor,Green,BRAIN,undefined,Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institution

Owing to the complexity of bridge design, traditional design methods always create tedious and time-consuming construction processes. In recent years, Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been developed rapidly to provide a faster solution to generate and process the integration of information in a shared environment. This paper aims to highlight an innovative 6D BIM approach for the lifecycle asset management of a bridge infrastructure by using Donggou Bridge as a case study. This paper adopts 6D modelling, incorporating 3D model information with time schedule, cost estimation, and carbon footprint analysis across the lifecycle of the bridge project. The results of this paper reveal that raw materials contribute the most embodied carbon emissions, and as the 6D BIM model was developed in the early stage of the lifecycle, stakeholders can collaborate within the BIM environment to enhance a more sustainable and cost-effective outcome in advance. This study also demonstrates the possibility of BIM applications to bridge infrastructure projects throughout the whole lifecycle. The 6D BIM can save time by transforming 2D information to 3D information and reducing errors during the pre-construction and construction stages through better visualisation for staff training. Moreover, 6D BIM can promote efficient asset and project management since it can be applied for various purposes simultaneously, such as sustainability, lifecycle asset management and maintenance, condition monitoring and real-time structural simulations. In addition, BIM can promote cooperation among working parties and improve visualisation of the project for various stakeholders.",6D | Bridges | Building information modelling (BIM) | Carbon emission | Cost | Life cycle | Planning and scheduling,57,1,repositoryvor,Green,EC,691135,European Commission

However, to date, environmental assessments of RTGs have only focused on specific crops, without considering the impacts resulting from seasonality, combinations of crops and nonoperational time. We analyze vegetable production in an RTG over 4 years to determine the crop combinations that minimize yearly environmental impacts while diversifying food supply. Methods: The system under study consists of an integrated RTG (i-RTG) with a hydroponic system in Barcelona, in the Mediterranean region. By using life cycle assessment (LCA), we evaluate the environmental performance of 25 different crop cycles and 7 species cultivated during the period 2015–2018. Three functional units are used: 1 kg of edible fresh production, 1 unit of economic value (€) in the wholesale market and 1 kcal of nutritional value. The system boundaries consider two subsystems: infrastructure (greenhouse structure, rainwater harvesting system and auxiliary equipment) and operation (fertilizers and their emissions into water and substrate). In addition, we perform an eco-efficiency analysis, considering the carbon footprint of the crop cycles and their value at the wholesale market during their harvesting periods. Results and discussion: Spring tomato cycles exert the lowest impacts in all categories, considering all three functional units, due to the high yields obtained. In contrast, spinach and arugula have the highest impacts. Regarding relative impact, the greenhouse structure presented a large impact, while fertilizer production had notable relative contributions in tomato cycles. Moreover, nitrogen and phosphorus emissions from fertigation are the main causes of freshwater and marine eutrophication. By combining the most eco-efficient cycles, we can see that growing two consecutive tomato cycles is the best alternative with the functional unit of yield (0.49 kg CO2 eq./kg), whereas a long spring tomato cycle combined with bean and lettuce cycles in the autumn/winter is the best scenario when using market (0.70 kg CO2 eq./€) and nutritional value (3.18·10−3 kg CO2/ kcal). Conclusions: This study shows that increasing the diversity of the system leads to better environmental performance of greenhouse urban agriculture if suitable crops are selected for the autumn/winter season. The functional unit involving the economic value and the eco-efficiency analysis are useful to demonstrate the capability of the growing system to produce added-value vegetables under harsher conditions while categorizing and classifying the crops to select the most suitable combinations based on economic and environmental parameters.",Crop combinations | Eco-efficiency | Industrial ecology | Life cycle assessment | Rooftop greenhouses | Sustainability | Urban agriculture | Urban metabolism,24,0,repositoryam,Green,AEU,031B0018,Asociación Española de Urología

To do so, we conduct a life-cycle environmental impact assessment, quantifying greenhouse gas emissions associated with building construction and seismic performance, accounting for potential earthquake damage and subsequent repairs. The unit of analysis is a modern code-designed reinforced concrete frame building, designed with seven different types of concrete: a conventional concrete mix, 3 concrete mixes in which varying quantities of fly ash replace cement, and 3 concrete mixes in which varying quantities of recycled concrete replace virgin coarse aggregate. The findings suggest that replacing cement with fly ash can be an effective tool to improve building sustainability over the entire life cycle, reducing greenhouse gas emissions during both construction and service life (seismic) life-cycle stages, without compromising seismic performance (i.e., resilience). However, replacing virgin coarse aggregate with recycled concrete aggregate can have unintended consequences in terms of worsening seismic performance and hence making the overall life-cycle sustainability calculus unfavorable in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. This paper is one of the first to link life-cycle seismic and environmental performance of buildings designed with alternative (and potentially green) concretes and to demonstrate the importance of considering tradeoffs between resilience and sustainability in design and selection of alternative structural materials. In addition, this study illustrates a framework that can be applied for life-cycle assessment and evaluation of structural concrete material choices.",,15,0,,,NSF,1234503,National Science Foundation

Much research has gone into the improved efficiency of building operation and construction products. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is commonly used to assess existing buildings or building products. Classic LCA, however, is not suited for evaluating the environmental performance of developing technologies. A new approach, anticipatory LCA (a-LCA), promises various advantages and can be used as a design constraint during the product development stage. It helps overcome four challenges: (i) data availability, (ii) stakeholder inclusion, (iii) risk assessment, and (iv) multi-criteria problems. This article's contribution to the line of research is twofold: first, it adapts the a-LCA approach for construction-specific purposes in theoretical terms for the four challenges. Second, it applies the method to an innovative prefabricated modular envelope system, the CleanTechBlock (CTB), focusing on challenge (i). Thirty-six CTB designs are tested and compared to conventional walls. Inclusion of technology foresight is achieved through structured scenario analysis. Moreover, challenge (iv) is tackled through the analysis of different environmental impact categories, transport-related impacts, and thickness of the wall assemblies of the CTB. The case study results show that optimized material choice and product design is needed to reach the lowest environmental impact.

However, the concept and method of sustainability has not been implemented and applied in bridge engineering. Also, with the development of informatization and digitalization, the traditional bridge design can no longer meet the requirements of sustainability and digital design thinking based on big data can bring new potentials and opportunities for traditional bridge design. As the country with the largest bridge construction, the scale of new medium and small span bridges in China is increasing every year. While promoting urbanization, the bridge engineering plays an important role in achieving the United Nation’s sustainable development goals (UN SDGs). Therefore, this study comprehensively assessed the status of the bridges achieving the carbon emission reduction target in the General Atlas of Highway and Bridge Design (GAHBD), so as to provide quantifiable and feasible suggestions ultimately for sustainable design of highway bridges. In the study, a simply supported T-beam bridge with a span of 30 meters in the GAHBD was selected as a specific design case. The research contents are as follows: (1) simulating the bridge design schemes (100,000 magnitude) by changing the geometric and physical parameters of the bridge, analyzing all possibilities of designed bridges comprehensively and quantifying the CO2 emissions of all schemes; (2) using the big data-based analysis method the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) to operate correlation analysis of the geometric and physical parameters with the reliability, life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) of the simulated bridges; (3) establishing the limit state of carbon emissions per unit GDP for the bridges under different scenarios for the next 20 years which considers relevent policies on the implementation of climate change action and the GDP growth scenarios under different shared socioeconomic pathways in China. Bridges that meet the carbon emission limit state was selected after analyzing the failure status of CO2 emission reduction in the bridge design stage; (4) calculating the reliability, LCA and LCC of the bridges that meet the carbon emission limit state, establishing a comprehensive sustainable model and obtaining the final sustainable design. Here we show, in the current policy scenario, the bridge design schemes based on the GAHBD could meet the carbon reduction target of 2030; in the new policy scenario, the bridge design schemes only meet the carbon reduction target of 2025; in the sustainable development scenario, however, none of the bridge design schemes meet the carbon emission reduction targets in any period of time.",,0,0,,,,undefined,

LCA is a quantitative tool for assessing the environmental performance of products or systems during its life span, through the compilation and further evaluation of the inputs, outputs, and potential environmental impacts The life cycle of the house included a 50-year lifespan house divided into three stages: pre-occupation, occupation, and postoccupation stage. The type of house chosen for the analysis represents the current trend of urban growth and planning of the city, which is pointing towards residential zones and housing plans far away from central areas. The notion of household metabolism is associated with the occupation stage. Household metabolism refers to all flows of matter and energy related to anthropogenic activities conducted on a household, which is a socio-economic entity that consists of people living together occupying a dwelling or part of it. Households are key entities of the anthroposphere because the sum of all private households is the process on which all other processes depend on and serve directly or indirectly. The total energy use and emissions for which the sum of households is responsible reflects the importance of considering its influence when assessing the environmental impact of dwellings. Five energy case scenarios were analyzed. These included different energy mixes and the use of inductive cookers as an alternative to those that use liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which are the most used in Ecuador. The influence of the energy production structure of the country on the environmental impact of the household is supported by the results. A higher share of hydroelectricity in the energy mix, compared with the share of thermal electricity, presented lower environmental impacts in most categories. Public policies that encourage a shift towards a cleaner electricity production technology may decrease the overall environmental impact of households and buildings. The occupation stage entails the highest contribution to all impact categories, e.g. 88% of global warming potential (GWP), followed by the pre-occupation stage, contributing 10% of GWP. Food consumption has not been considered in reviewed studies, although it represents the highest environmental burden within the occupation stage of the house, followed by electricity, and gas use: 43, 27, and 20% of GWP respectively. The results support the importance of including household metabolism in LCA studies due to the high environmental burden associated with it, and the influence of the electricity production structure of the country on the life cycle impact of households.",carbon footprint | energy mix | food | global warming | houses | LCA,0,0,,,,undefined,

The conceptualization of change is a relevant part of energy and sustainability transitions research, which is aimed at enabling radical shifts compatible with societal functions. In this framework, building performance has to be considered in a whole life cycle perspective because buildings are long-term assets. In a life cycle perspective, both operational and embodied energy and carbon emissions have to be considered for appropriate comparability and decision-making. The application of sustainability assessments of products and practices in the built environment is itself a critical and debatable issue. For this reason, the way energy consumption data are measured, processed, and reported has to be progressively standardized in order to enable transparency and consistency of methods at multiple scales (from single buildings up to building stock) and levels of analysis (from individual components up to systems), ideally complementing ongoing research initiatives that use open science principles in energy research.

A feasibility analysis of this kind of move has been studied by performing techno-economic-environmental analysis of a four-layered SCN using second generation lignocellulose bio mass as feedstock. Using supply chain flow decisions as continuous variables and the existence and connectivity between the nodes among nodes in several echelons as binary variables, overall net present value of the supply chain network is maximized using transport, storage, production and import as operating expenditure and infrastructure as capital expenditure. The overall objective function also considered the revenue generation from selling the final product and also from the carbon credits via greenhouse gas emission savings throughout the project life cycle assessment. External imports are allowed to meet the unmet demand and maintain the product quality in terms of research octane number. With ~80% increase in demand in bioethanol and ~37% increase in biodiesel over the 9-year planning horizon, a dynamically changing SC structure coming as an outcome of the aforementioned mixed integer linear programming framework shows overall ~88% increase in the newly added locations.

In this paper, IBS is classified to aluminium formwork system and fully precast concrete structure. The carbon footprint is quantified with life cycle assessment (LCA) of the building dividing into production phase of materials, transportation phase and construction phase. Whereas the study adopted data of embodied carbon of materials and carbon emission factor from reliable external source to estimate the total carbon emission of the project with the application of IBS. The outcome of carbon footprint is compared with conventional building method to identify the sustainability of each building method. Based on the data analysis, the application of precast concrete has the lowest carbon footprint as compared to cast-in situ with aluminium formwork and timber formwork. Although the carbon emission from the transportation of precast concrete elements is relatively high, but the overall carbon footprint is still the lowest among the other building method. The amount of carbon emission of the commercial project with IBS construction is 0.342 tonnes CO2 per meter square. The production of construction materials that contributed the most to the carbon footprint is concrete, followed by steel rebar and formwork. The findings in this study is very useful for future research on carbon footprint of construction in Malaysia.

Analysis on single buildings often excludes components related with urban scale such as construction of infrastructure, distance to city centre and transportation. Research on neighbourhood-scale settlements is necessary to further develop the understanding of the environmental impact of built-environment. This study aims to develop a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) framework for the embodied carbon assessment of the built environment at neighbourhood scale. The study validates the results on three neighbourhood-scale mass housing projects in Ankara, Turkey. Embodied carbon assessment of these projects were conducted in order to generate a reference model of mass-housing projects. A data management framework for carbon assessment was also provided in the study. According to the results, an average of 409.2 kgCO2-eq/m2 originated at the neighbourhood level including emissions from the buildings, structural landscape and transportation infrastructure. Buildings contribute 272.4 kgCO2-eq/m2, which comprise 66.6% of the total emissions. On the other hand, 37.4 kgCO2-eq/m2 (9.1%) originate from structural landscape and 99.4 kgCO2-eq/m2 (24.3%) originate from transportation infrastructure. The results reveal the necessity to widen the assessment boundaries when investigating embedded carbon in larger scale built environment for fairer results.

Concrete production is also associated with high carbon emissions and the large-scale depletion of natural resources. Recently, the addition of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) in cementitious materials has shown a potential to improve the performance and instigate additional functionalities. However, there is limited understanding around the environmental effects from the production of GNP and its incorporation in concrete. This study has investigated, by means of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), the environmental impact of concrete reinforced with graphene nanoplatelets by focusing on the “cradle-to-gate” of GNP production and their incorporation in concrete. The production of 1 kg of G2NanPaste (GNPs product) is found to result in 0.17 kgCO2 equivalent units which is lower than Portland cement (0.86 kgCO2 eq). Ordinary Portland cement (CEM I) is 248 times more damaging than G2NanPaste in terms of global warming. The superplasticiser addition is found to have a greater environmental impact compared to G2NanPaste. The sensitivity analysis showed that if the addition of GNPs results in a 5% reduction of the Portland cement, the effect of the concrete mix on global warming can be reduced by 21%. This indicates that GNPs could be environmentally friendly if used as a supplement for some of the cement. The main aim of this paper is to perform the first LCA of the addition of graphene nanoplatelets in concrete.

The workability, rheological behavior, buildability, and mechanical properties of the cement-based composites for 3D printing were examined systematically. The rheological analysis revealed that the plastic viscosity and yield stress of mortars with 1 wt% MCC were increased by 20.9% and 190.0%, respectively, compared with those of mortars without MCC. The buildability of mortars with 1 wt% MCC was also improved, and the printed structure exhibited neither large cracks among the printed filaments nor distorted components in the printing process. Compared with the mortars without MCC, the 28-d compressive and flexural strengths of the mortars with 1 wt% MCC were increased by 18.6% and 12.5%, respectively. In addition, the carbon emissions from the overall life cycle of a printed residence were quantified by considering the material attributes of additive manufacturing and using software tools to conduct building information modeling (BIM)-enabled life cycle assessment (LCA) modeling. The results indicated that compared with the mortars without MCC at equivalent mechanical strengths, the mortars containing 1 wt% MCC could reduce the CO2 emissions by 6.82%.

To solve this problem, adaptation of buildings to control of thermal comfort and its impact on their energy consumption is a solution considered. In building envelope, technical improvement of the window goes in this direction. From simple glazing, practically no more used in Europe, to double glazing, four times more thermally efficient than the previous one, triple glazing is used now, the most insulating of the three. Because the magnitude of climate change depends mainly on greenhouse gas emissions, a comparative Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) between a uPVC double and triple glazed window is carried out in this study. But rather than using a conventional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), we use a Dynamic LCA (Dy-LCA) because giving more realistic results by introducing the temporal dimension. Indeed, the contribution of each gas to the greenhouse effect is determined by the characteristics of that gas, its abundance, and any indirect effects it may cause. For example, the direct radiative effect of a mass of methane is about 84 times stronger than the same mass of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame but it is present in much smaller concentrations so that its total direct radiative effect is smaller, in part due to its shorter atmospheric lifetime. To take into account temporal dimension, ESPA (Enhanced Structural Path Analysis) method, coupled with Open LCA software, is used in this research work. So, a Dynamic Life Cycle Inventory (Dy-LCI) is determined and analyzed for these two products.",Building envelope | Dynamic Life Cycle Assessment | Dynamic Life Cycle Inventory | ESPA method | greenhouse gas,0,0,,,,undefined,

Results and discussion: Concrete structures have a potential service life much longer than the minimum value prescribed in the codes, in this case study, more than five times. Reinforced concrete is subject to degradation and aging with time and several models existing to assess the effects. In addition, a structure can be refurbished, which strongly affects its service life. These different strategies when applied to a case study result in differences of up to 65% in non-renewable primary energy consumption in a 250-year period. Embodied energy and CO2 per year of buildings which are not constant values. The appropriate strategy for a specific case study must be taken into account to select the value of service life in LCA. Conclusions: Reinforced concrete is a highly impacting material, but also a material with a long potential service life. This durability is not considered in the LCA if the service life value is restricted to the minimum one prescribed in the codes. Demolishing a structure (and therefore, a building) that can last 250 years after just 50 or 80 is a highly impacting action. Refurbishment can ensure this durability and even extend it.",Buildings | Energy consumption | Life cycle assessment | Refurbishment | Reinforced concrete | Service life,5,0,,,MECD,FPU15/01069,"Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte"

Although bike sharing is viewed as a sustainable transportation mode, it still has environmental footprints from its operation (e.g., bike rebalancing using automobiles) and upstream impacts (e.g., bike manufacturing). Thus, evaluating the environmental impacts of BSS from the life cycle perspective is vital to inform decision making for the system design and operation. In this study, we conducted a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) of station-based and dock-less BSS in the U.S. The results show that dock-less BSS has a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions factor of 118 g CO2-eq/bike-km in the base scenario, which is 82% higher than the station-based system. Bike rebalancing is the main source of GHG emissions, accounting for 36% and 73% of the station-based and dock-less systems, respectively. However, station-based BSS has 54% higher total normalized environmental impacts (TNEI), compared to dock-less BSS. The dock manufacturing dominants the TNEI (61%) of station-based BSS and the bike manufacturing contributes 52% of TNEI in dock-less BSS. BSS can also bring environmental benefits through substituting different transportation modes. Car trip replacement rate is the most important factor. The results suggest four key approaches to improve BSS environmental performance: 1) optimizing the bike distribution and rebalancing route or repositioning bikes using more sustainable approaches, 2) incentivizing more private car users to switch to using BSSs, 3) prolonging lifespans of docking infrastructure to significantly reduce the TNEI of station-based systems, and 4) increasing the bike utilization efficiency to improve the environmental performance of dock-less systems.",Bike sharing | Dock-less | Life cycle assessment | Station-based,88,0,,,,undefined,

This study aims to introduce a framework to systematically integrate seismic-resilience into sustainability assessment of structures/infrastructures. A case study of a multi-story limited-ductility reinforced-concrete (RC) building with soft-story collapse mechanism is presented. This mode of failure is often expected in regions of low to moderate seismicity, where the detailing is poor. A numerical model is constructed based on the results of a number of multi-axis hybrid simulations allowing to realistically capture the three-dimensional response and the damage states of the RC building first-story columns from linear-elastic range to collapse. In addition, the application of carbon-fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) as a cost-effective and rapid repair strategy in restoring the building columns is studied. The CFRP repair is proposed as an alternative to the demolition of the full building when subjected to large deformations; thereby, significantly enhancing post-disaster reparability and resilience of the structure. The developed numerical models are then used to quantify the sustainability metrics including repair cost, repair downtime and repair environmental impacts. These metrics are quantified by consecutive hazard, structural response, damage state, and recovery loss analyses in accordance to the PEER PBEE methodology. The results are then used to quantify the resilience parameters, including loss of performance and recovery, using the probabilistic resilience-based earthquake engineering (RBEE) approach.",CFRP-repair | Hybrid simulation | RC building | Seismic resilience | Sustainability assessment,43,0,,,,undefined,

To address the need for change in the building industry and transform its hazardous impacts on the environment to a positive footprint, circular economic design approaches and Whole-Life Carbon (WLC) assessment have been introduced. This paper analyses the main barriers for a successful implementation of the regenerative Cradle to Cradle (C2C) concept and WLC evaluation, identifying the lack of unified and measurable framework along with the deficiency of detailed case studies and post occupancy evaluation. In the context of the increasing demand for carbon accounting, obtaining comprehensive information on embodied carbon in buildings is challenging despite the existing Life Cycle Assessment structure. To link theory with practice, the paper discusses the London School of Economics Centre Buildings Redevelopment by RSH+P as case study. It reveals barriers and opportunities for WLC evaluation as well as the potential of life cycle cost optimization in environmental and economic terms. The paper concludes with a reflection on how the certification of materials through material passports may not only achieve a higher transparency but lead to a circular economic building industry by comprehensive WLC assessment and a closer implementation of reversible building design corresponding to the C2C principles. The potential of combining WLC evaluation with C2C strategies and translating them into a comprehensive, unified assessment framework for a circular building sector is identified.",,5,1,repositoryam,Green,H2020,642384,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

A more comprehensive study is needed based on an international perspective as the standards and methods used for estimating emissions have not yet been integrated with international standards. It is necessary to quantify the life cycle emissions from reinforced concrete structures through a variety of actual engineering data and a multi-case empirical study to establish their standard value, in order to promote the rapid development of low-carbon buildings in China. Internationally, reinforced concrete structures are often grouped under six types: schools, hospitals, aerospace, commercial, residential, and prisons. This study examines residential, hospitals, commercial and schools as examples for multiple case studies. Life cycle cost analysis (LCA) principles, multi-case analysis and quantitative studies are combined to assemble a CO2 emission assessment model in SimaPro to evaluate the CO2 emission over the life cycle of a representative sample of reinforced concrete structures in China with the aim of developing proposals for energy-saving emission reductions. The results indicate that steel contributes 40%–53% to global warming and 40%–80% of the total environmental emissions during the construction phase of the buildings analyzed, with energy saving in the building materials production phase, especially steel production. The amount of CO2 emissions is generally 30% more in the use and maintenance phase than the construction phase, reaching even 300% for hospital buildings. By contrast, CO2 emissions during the demolition phase are relatively small, accounting for only 3%–12% of the building's life cycle. In terms of building type, the life-cycle CO2 emissions of hospital buildings are much larger than other types of reinforced concrete structures, reaching 3390 kg CO2 eq/m2.",Building carbon emissions | Case research | Energy conservation | Impact assessment | LCA | SimaPro,44,0,,,LCC,300103282803,Robert H.

Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is a commonly used and well-established tool to estimate the total emissions caused by buildings throughout their entire life cycle. Yet, LCAs of more complex systems such as neighbourhoods are scarce. We have developed an LCA model for neighbourhoods with a focus on GHG emissions based on a modular structure with five physical elements: buildings, mobility, open spaces, networks and on-site energy infrastructure. We applied it on the Zero Village Bergen pilot project in Norway. The results give total GHG emissions of 117 ktons CO2-eq over 60 years, equivalent to 1.5 tons CO2-eq/capita/year or 21.2 kg CO2-eq/m2/year on average over the period. The buildings constitute the largest share of emissions among the elements with 52%, then mobility with 40%, and only 2.3% from networks and open spaces. Emissions embodied in the materials consumed in all the elements of the neighbourhood account for as much as 56% of total emissions, with a large share coming from materials consumed in mobility vehicles.

To find these environmental burdens, 17 construction projects of the “Austrian Service for Torrent and Avalanche Control” (WLV) were analyzed using the “cradle to gate with options” LCA methodology (CEN, 2013). Methods: This article explains an LCA methodology for the product stage and the construction process of torrent control structures following existing standards. The iterative approach of LCA methodology (ISO, 2006a) was used to record all important processes of the system and to supplement missing information. The LCA methodology has been developed from existing standards of the construction and product sector. Since the production of some construction materials takes place locally, the generic data, for Austria, was adapted. Wood inherent biogenic carbon and primary energy, used as raw material, are treated as materials inherent properties (CEN, 2014). The contribution of the various processes was reproduced by hotspot. Results and discussion: Hotspots of the different stages are related to the construction materials used. The emissions and primary energy inputs in the product stage are clearly dominated by concrete and steel. If these two materials are used sparingly, the focus is on machine application and transportation. Depending on the selected scenarios, the smallest share of emissions, in relation to the total result of product and construction stage emitted by transport, is 3% and the maximum share is 69%. The greatest environmental impacts in the construction stage are caused by excavation work and transportation on-site. With an average of 4% in the construction stage, the transport of workers to the construction site cannot be neglected as is done in the building sector. Conclusions: The conclusion of this study is that existing LCA models can be adapted to protective structures. In contrast to conventional buildings, the construction process and transportation are much more important and cannot be neglected. Shifting the hotspots to these processes requires specific calculation rules for that particular field. There is still a need for research to find a suitable functional unit and to develop a methodology for the use and end of life stage of these structures.",Civil engineering | Hotspot analysis | Life cycle engineering | Screening LCA | System boundary | Torrent control structures,5,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,BOKU,undefined,Klima- und Energiefonds

Starting from design and construction to operation and demolition, various building materials are used throughout the whole building lifecycle involving significant energy consumption and waste generation. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is emerging as a tool that can support holistic design-decision making for reducing embodied carbon and waste production in the building lifecycle. This study aims to establish a framework for assessing embodied carbon and waste underpinned by BIM technology. On the basis of current research review, the framework is considered to include functional modules for embodied carbon computation. There is a module for waste estimation, a knowledge-base of construction and demolition methods, a repository of building components information, and an inventory of construction materials' energy and carbon. Through both static 3D model visualisation and dynamic modelling supported by the framework, embodied carbon, waste and associated costs can be analysed in the boundary of cradle-to-gate, construction, operation, and demolition. The proposed holistic modelling framework provides a possibility to analyse embodied carbon and waste from different building lifecycle perspectives including associated costs. It brings together existing segmented embodied carbon and waste estimation into a unified model, so that interactions between various parameters through the different building lifecycle phases can be better understood. Thus, it can improve design-decision support for optimal low impact building development. The applicability of this framework is anticipated being developed and tested on industrial projects in the near future.",BIM | Embodied carbon | Holistic design framework | Low impact building | Waste estimation,0,0,,,,undefined,

These structures can experience multiple low probability-high consequence natural hazards, such as earthquake, during their long lifetime. Vast economic, social, and environmental consequences of seismic-induced damages to bridges demand for comprehensive multi-faceted lifecycle analysis of bridges. Commonly, the primary focus of lifecycle analysis frameworks has been the assessment of economic consequences of infrastructure investments and little attention has been given to the analysis of social and environmental impacts. This study investigates the economic and environmental impacts of various retrofit plans for bridges quantified over the lifetime of the infrastructure in order to determine the most sustainable plan. Since bridges are long-lived systems and may encounter several occurrences of earthquakes during their lifetime, effects of repair actions being incomplete prior to the occurrence of the next hazard can play a significant role in the sustainability assessment. Therefore, in this study, a probabilistic framework is developed to incorporate effects of multiple occurrences of earthquakes and incomplete repair actions for damages induced under stochastically generated future seismic events. Sustainability here is quantified in terms of economic and environmental indicators, which are based on the expected lifecycle cost, expected carbon dioxide emissions, and expected energy waste in the lifetime of the infrastructure. Results of this investigation facilitate analysis of sustainability metrics, allowing for objective consideration of sustainability in determining optimal investment decisions.",,15,0,,,,undefined,

To illustrate how choices made by the designer affect the environmental impact of the structure, this study compares solutions in steel, concrete and Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) for footbridges of 15m and 25m span as they exist today. Boundary conditions have been set in advance and the designs have been prepared to the same level of depth by senior engineers with comparable expertise in the respective materials. The concepts have been compared on CO2 -emissions over the life cycle, including maintenance. End-of-life (EoL) scenarios are described qualitatively but it is debated how to include these in the CO2 -emissions, as in a 100 years' time technologies for recycling will be substantially different from today's. Including the EoL in this comparison study therefore means that a uncertain parameter is made part of the equation. Use has been made of the EcoInvent database and the EuCIA Eco Impact Calculator, an environmental impact tool developed by the FRP industry association using the latest data available on FRP.

The objective of this study is to reduce the environmental-economic (shadow) costs of precast reinforced concrete (RC) beams in a conventional Dutch office building, thereby improving its MPG score. Two main optimizations are introduced: first, the amount of concrete is reduced, designing a cavity in the cross-section of the beam; second, part of the reinforcement is replaced with a fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) tube. The structural calculations draw from a combination of several codes and FRP recommendations. Hollow FRP-RC beams (with an elongated oval cavity), and flax, glass, and kenaf fibre tubes yielded the lowest shadow costs. In particular, the flax tube obtained shadow costs that were 39% lower than those of the hollow RC beam (with an elongated oval cavity); which also contributed to decreasing the shadow costs of other building components (e.g., facade), thereby reducing the MPG score of the building. However, this study also shows that it is important to select the right type of FRP as hemp fibre tubes resulted in a 98% increase in shadow costs.",Carbon | Cross-sectional design | Fibre reinforced polymer | Flax fibres | FRP | Glass | Kenaf | MPG score | Prefabricated precast concrete beams | Shadow cost,6,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Policies are also going in this direction and as a consequence in the recent years researchers and practitioners are coming up with new materials, technologies and practices designed to reduce the negative impacts of their activities in the surroundings. Within this framework the road pavements sector is witnessing a paradigm shift towards the development of pavement technologies incorporating high-content of recycled materials, as well as best practices to decrease the overall carbon footprint. These are all promising solutions that to the most can sound as sustainable practices. However the whole road pavement community is still investigating methodologies and tools to define what actually sustainable means and thereby performing a sustainable decision-making. It is within this context that the need of a sustainability-based decision support system (DSS) that could help road pavement engineers at the design stage was identified and is here presented. The Sustainable Pavements & Railways DSS (SUP&R DSS) relies on a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method to rank the sustainability of alternatives. It applies life cycle-based approaches to quantify the values of a set of indicators purposely and methodologically selected to capture the cause-effect link between the general concepts of the three wellbeing dimensions of sustainability, i.e., environmental, economic and social, and the infrastructure construction and maintenance practice. Furthermore, the system allows selecting different weighting for the indicators but offers also a default set of values derived from a survey conducted with over 50 stakeholders in Europe and beyond. Together with the development, structure and features of the SUP&R DSS, this paper present its applicability by means of a case study aiming at identifying the most sustainable asphalt mixture for wearing courses. Several promising options for flexible road pavements were selected, ranging from low to hot temperature asphalt. The results show that a foamed warm mix asphalt mixture with a reclaimed asphalt pavement content of 50% is the most sustainable among the competing alternatives. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis conducted to investigate the influence of the indicators weights, the parameters of the MCDA method and the long-term performance of the alternative asphalt mixtures on the stability of the ranking showed that its first position in the ranking remained unaffected.",Life cycle thinking | Multi-criteria decision analysis | Sustainability assessment | Sustainable design | Sustainable engineering | Sustainable pavements,42,0,repositoryam,Green,FP7,607524,Seventh Framework Programme

Besides, they leave out thermal comfort aspect and insulation status of the buildings. The current study is an effort to fill those gaps. The approach is tested in a case study, a hypothetical building's living room that is incorporated with a TW. A simple parametric study has been carried out by varying the TW area from 6.0 m2 to 16.2 m2 to perform energy and economic assessments. The results revealed that for thermally insulated new building where the room is only occupied in winter the construction of a TW is economically viable. If the building is not thermally insulated, the construction of a TW is only feasible if its area is greater than 9 m2. It is observed that the economic viability of the TW becomes better as its area increases. If the room is used in summer as well, there will be an extra cooling load due to the existence of the TW and economic feasibility is only achieved if there is insulation in the building. In uninsulated existing buildings, the construction of a TW is not economically feasible. The cumulative distribution frequency of various comfort parameters such as room temperature, relative humidity and CO2 concentration levels are also plotted for each feasible TW area for determining the best personal comfort level.",Economic feasibility | Energy simulation | LCC analysis | Trombe wall,17,0,,,,undefined,

There is increasing attention to quantify urban green areas and the related benefits to the extent that the Italian National Statistics Institute (ISTAT) scores the ""green value"" of the main cities. There are still uncertainties on the classification of the green areas and their potential to provide services that collectively improve the urban life quality. This study analysed the green areas of the urban environment of Matera city, focussing on their category (private gardens, school gardens, green streets and urban parks) and size and their potential to serve as CO2 sink. The analyses were carried out on four representative areas and the size of the various categories was assessed through cadastral and other municipal data. The urbanization process had influences on urban ecosystems including plant biodiversity, increasing the abundance of plant alien species. Knowledge on the spread of alien plant species might help to prevent the biodiversity loss. Therefore, a qualitative survey of the existing alien plant species in the urban environment was performed. Preliminary results show that the urban green area calculated in this study is 90 ha. In addition, private gardens share a higher surface of urban green areas, reflecting a good greening aptitude of citizens. Considering that the green areas within built environment is most beneficial for human well-being, a possible scenario related to the carbon (C) sequestration by these areas in Matera city will be presented. A potential green corridor connecting some existing spot green areas to promote social aspects and improve well-being of citizens and environmental sustainability will also be discussed. This study might be supportive for urban planners and local policy makers, contributing to drive future decisions towards a greener built environment of Matera city.",City | CO  sequestration 2 | Green infrastructure | Urban structure,0,0,,,,undefined,

Furthermore, the energy and carbon implications of recycled aggregate concrete in material level and low-rise structural level have been investigated. However, little attention has been paid to investigating the effects of adoption of recycled aggregate concrete as structural material on the carbon footprint of high-rise buildings, typical of common structures in megacities such as Shanghai, China. To address this gap, this study investigates the carbon footprint of two identical twin towers, with one tower made of recycled aggregate concrete and the other made of natural aggregate concrete. The structures were designed by following Chinese building codes while optimizing the mix design of recycled aggregate concrete to achieve similar fresh and hardened concrete properties to natural aggregate concrete. The static behaviors and dynamic characteristics of structures were analyzed prior to evaluating the carbon footprint to ensure that both structures had equivalent functions. The global warming potential and cumulative energy demand indicators for the recycled aggregate concrete structure were calculated based on local data and compared with those of the same structure made with natural aggregate concrete. The results indicate that adoption of recycled aggregate concrete as structural material in the high-rise structure, in place of natural aggregate concrete, can result in up to about 2.175 × 105 kgCe decrease in carbon footprint in condition of this specific project. The effects of recycling strategy used and the transportation distances on embodied carbon and energy consumption further highlight the environmental benefits of promoting recycled aggregate concrete applications.",CO  emission analysis 2 | Dynamic characteristic | Embodied carbon | High-rise building | Life cycle assessment (LCA) | Recycled aggregate concrete (RAC),126,0,,,NSFC,5161101205,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Specifically, a novel method to simultaneously optimise the cost and embodied carbon performance of steel building structures was explored in this paper. To achieve this, a parametric design model was developed to analyse code compliant structural configurations based on project specific constraints and rigorous testing of various steel beam sections, floor construction typologies (precast or composite) and column layouts that could not be performed manually by engineering practitioners. Detailed objective functions were embedded in the model to compute the cost and life cycle carbon emissions of the different material types used in the structure. Results from a comparative numerical analysis of a real case study illustrated that the proposed optimisation approach could guide structural engineers towards areas of the solution space with realistic design configurations, enabling them to effectively evaluate trade-offs between cost and carbon performance. This significant contribution implied that the optimisation model could reduce the time required for the design and analysis of multiple structural configurations especially during the early stages of a project.

Recycling crushed concrete aggregates and using them as substitutes for natural ones might therefore be determinant in reducing landfilling and mineral resource depletion. An innovative way to give new value to Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RCAs) is to ram them in layers to form load-bearing walls for stabilised Rammed Earth (RE) applications. However, the success of those few existing RE projects using RCA is mainly due to the knowledge and experience of the contractors rather than official standards or guidelines or scientific literature. The objective of this study was to further the knowledge of this building technique by determining the effect of different RCA replacements on the material's mechanical resistance, sustainability and hygroscopic properties: indicative of the structure's structural, environmental and hygrothermal performance. Mechanical resistance was assessed by means of the Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS, commonly used for rammed earth-like materials), hygroscopic properties via Moisture Buffer Value (MBV) and sorption isotherms while the sustainability was assessed via consequential Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Microstructural investigations via mercury intrusion porosimetry, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction were performed to understand and explain material mechanical and hygroscopic behaviour. The building technique, already proven to be durable, was demonstrated to be resistant (from 4 to 12 MPa at 28 days depending on the RCA replacement and cement content), sustainable (down to 25 kg CO2-eq. of embodied carbon per square meter of load-bearing wall) and to have good moisture buffering abilities (0.88 g/(m2%RH) for mixtures containing only RCA). Strength appeared to be more related to the particle size distribution of the mix rather than to the percentage of RCA added. The amount and type of stabiliser added to the mix and the distance covered by the RCA during its lifetime strongly affected the environmental sustainability of the mixture; to maximise the potential of this building technique, reducing the amount of cement in the mixture by using alternative stabilisers should be the main priority.",Life Cycle Assessment | Microstructure | Moisture Buffer Value | Rammed Earth | Recycled Concrete Aggregate | Unconfined Compressive Strength,47,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

The overall carbon emissions and the costs during the building's life cycle are also assessed in different alternatives. According to results, the energy consumption is reduced from 7.9% to 14.8%.

Moreover, Construction sector is found to be the destination of the largest sector-to-sector environmental impact flows for the five impact categories and make the most contributions to the total environmental impacts. Another key finding is that Agriculture sector is both the largest net exporter and the greatest contributor for water withdrawal category.

Results indicate that main contribution to impacts occurs in manufacturing by stage and from PV modules by component. Impacts generated by the mounting structure and inverters are also significant, and together these components constitute over 90% of environmental burdens. A climate change impact of 0.079 kg CO2-eq/kWh is produced over the lifetime of the system. Energy Payback Time is calculated as 2.5 years, and the Economic Payback Period is 7.4 years. The system is estimated to avoid 1.00E+06 kg CO2-eq over its lifetime. Installation of similar rooftop PV systems on 50% of university and government buildings in Bangkok could result in a net reduction of 4.80E+09 kg CO2-eq.

To achieve this aim, mixed research approach was used. A comprehensive literature review and ten expert interviews were conducted first as a part to find out the significance of EC to the construction industry. Subsequently, a questionnaire survey and a base model building consisting of work studies, a desk study and a documentary review were used to collect the required data. The data collected were analyzed to find out the most suitable material out of the three types of wall materials selected. The results of the analysis indicate that eco interlocking brick is the most suitable wall material (compared to cement block and conventional brick) in terms of EC and initial and maintenance cost.

They have been built using local materials to effectively suit whole-life design, construction and maintenance. The choice of construction materials often affects the life cycle performance and plays a key role in resilience of rail assets and infrastructure in an uncertain setting derived from geotechnical risks, operational changes, natural hazards and climate change effects. Nowadays, in railway industry, various materials are being installed in railway tracks as supporting structure. Railway sleepers or ties are an important element, which redistributes wheel load onto track foundation and importantly secures rail gauge. Among them is manufactured by steel, timber, polymer, composite and concrete. The choice of these sleeper materials is mainly arisen from local suitability and compatibility in a specific railway network. This research is the world first to investigate the georisks and potential consequences on track capacity and performance of railway systems under climate uncertainties. Risk analysis and ranking has been conducted using rigorous evidences from critical literature review and expert interviews. This paper highlights track failure modes, short-term and long-term stability, and ground-borne vibration, which causes excessive maintenance and service downtime.

While calculation of embodied cradle-to-gate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is commonplace for ordinary portland cement (OPC) structural concrete elements in building-related LCAs, the carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestered by in situ carbonation of exposed OPC concrete is often neglected because the quantity of sequesterable CO2 is assumed trivial compared to the initial GHG emissions (kg CO2e) associated with their manufacture. Using a screening cradle-to-gate LCA and a previously developed and validated CO2 sequestration model for OPC concrete, this paper quantifies and compares estimates of the initial CO2e emissions to the CO2 sequestration potential of several OPC concrete elements at both finite (25 years) and infinite time intervals. The results demonstrate that, depending on cement type, compressive strength, structural geometry, and time, approximately 19%—a non-trivial sum—of initial CO2e emissions could be recoverable via CO2 sequestration for the concrete elements considered herein. Notably, however, concrete elements that sequester the most CO2 do not always result in the lowest net CO2e emissions.",CO  sequestration 2 | Concrete | GHG emissions | Lifecycle assessment,32,1,publisherfree2read,Bronze,NSF,1562557,National Science Foundation

However, embodied energy (EE) and carbon (EC) analysis requires significant time and effort to ensure the reliability of the LCA results. Therefore, a more comprehensive model of conducting the energy analysis is required to provide more realistic EE and EC analysis in turn. Hybrid LCA has been identified as the best model in improving the completeness of EE and EC inventory data. However, such a benefit was not empirically verified extensively, especially in the Malaysian construction industry. This paper demonstrates an extended application of hybrid LCA to Malaysian building design systems, and further investigates the completeness of the model. Finally, the potential for EE and EC reduction through the allocation of low EE and EC intensities of alternative materials, products or components has been evaluated. The results revealed that the hybrid LCA improved the completeness of the EE and EC inventory data compared with other models. By using low EE and EC intensity materials, products or components, a total EE and EC reduction of 43% and 41%, respectively was achieved.

Recent awareness in environmental problems has highlighted the need for considering environmental impacts into the process of making choices. However, far too little attention has been paid to reflect the environmental impact and the building cost into the decision making process. As such, this study proposed a method that integrates and considers the environmental cost and building cost in the structural design process. This method takes into account the cost associated with building materials, construction methods and amount of embodied carbon emission during the life cycle of buildings. The current study analysed the effects of two construction systems (Flat slab and waffle slab) and two structural materials (Normal concrete and Ultra-lightweight concrete) on overall costs of a typical high rise concrete structure (15-story office building) in Australia (NS11401.1 2014). The results show that the office building designed with lightweight construction method (waffle slab) and normal concrete (Normal weight) has a lower life cycle cost (50 year lifespan) in comparison with the other design alternatives. It was found that an appropriate selecting of construction forms and type of concrete can save up to 7% of the cost of material consumption, 5% of the total energy consumption expense, and 5% of the CO2-e emissions of the building across all five major cities. This study demonstrates a method to quantify the potential impact of Ultra-lightweight concrete has on the life cycle cost and carbon emissions of commercial buildings.

However, at the same time the few existing studies have observed higher levels of long-distance travel and particularly air travel in the same densely built parts of urban regions. This may lead to GHG emissions reduction in local travel offset by the concomitant increase in long-distance travel. With this study we aim to identify the main factors involved in differences in local, national and long-distance travel patterns and the resulting GHG emissions, with a special focus on the role of the different urban zones in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA) in Finland. We used a softGIS survey to collect data on the personal travel of young adults living in HMA. SoftGIS methodology provides the opportunity to obtain detailed spatial data on participants’ residential locations, travel destinations, and destination characteristics such as travel modes, frequencies and trip purposes. Special attention was paid to national and international trips, for which data were collected over 12 months, a period long enough to capture actual travel patterns. GHG emissions were assessed with a wide scope life cycle assessment (LCA) approach, including vehicles and infrastructure, and the results were elaborated with a two-part regression model on participation in travel and amount of GHG emissions. The study found that the residential location was associated with travel emissions on all scales, and independently from major socioeconomic characteristics. Residents of centrally located and densely built urban zones have on average lower emissions from local travel but higher emissions from international travel than residents of car-oriented suburban zones, and the association holds true after controlling for income, education level and household type. Differences in emissions from local travel between most central and most suburban zones were almost completely offset by differences in emissions from international travel. International long-distance trips were a dominant source of travel-related GHG emissions in all urban zones, particularly due to plane flights.",Carbon footprint | Greenhouse gas emissions | Long-distance travel | Travel behavior | Urban structure,41,0,,,HI,undefined,Academy of Finland

This study presents a comprehensive environmental assessment of food production in an integrated rooftop greenhouse (i-RTG) – an innovative vertical farm consisting of a rooftop greenhouse connected to a building – and considers rainwater, residual heat (energy), residual air (CO2) and food from an industrial ecology perspective. This synergistic connection preserves resources and improves conditions in the greenhouse and the building. The goal of the study is to show the feasibility of the system and to calculate the environmental impacts from its whole life cycle, from infrastructure to end of life, by comparing these impacts with those of conventional production. The results show that the system is feasible and produced 30.2 kg/m2 of tomato over 15.5 months. The synergy with the building allows the cultivation of winter-fall crops without supplying heating and maintained an average temperature 8 °C higher than that outdoors. Moreover, rainwater was used to irrigate the crops, reducing consumption from the water supply network by 80–90%. The environmental assessment showed that the operation of the i-RTG has more impacts than the infrastructure (structure of the greenhouse, rainwater harvesting system and equipment) due to the use of fertilisers, which account for 25% of the impacts in four of the six impact categories studied. Regarding the infrastructure, the greenhouse structure and rainwater harvesting system of the building have substantial environmental impacts (over 30% in four of the six impact categories). Comparison with a conventional greenhouse demonstrates that the i-RTG has a better environmental performance, showing between 50 and 75% lower impacts in five of the six impact categories (for instance, 0.58 kg of CO2 equivalent per kg of tomato vs. 1.7 kg), mainly due to the reduced packaging and transport requirements. From this study, it was concluded that optimisation of the amount of infrastructure material and management of the operation could lead to even better environmental performance in future i-RTG projects.",Food security | Industrial ecology | LCA | Urban agriculture | Vertical farming | Water-energy-food nexus,84,0,repositoryam,Green,CONACYT,CTM2013-47067-C2-1-R,Generalitat de Catalunya

Typically, in LCA methods, when a sustainable forestry management is assumed, biogenic carbon is not included in the calculation since forest products are considered as carbon neutral due to the full regeneration of biomass in forest at the end of a rotation period. The purpose of this article is to investigate the effect of storing carbon in biogenic materials and lime-based products when they are used as construction materials and left long in a building. Five different alternative exterior walls with different construction technologies are compared. In the first two alternatives (STR and HEM), a significant amount of fast-growing biogenic material is used as thermal insulation, while the third (TIM) represents a typical timber frame structure with mineral insulation. The last two are traditional wall alternatives based on bricks (BRI) and cast concrete (CON) with an additional external thermal insulation composite system (ETICS) in EPS. A model based on a dynamic LCA is adopted to include timing in the calculation. The results, expressed in terms of radiative forcing in the atmosphere, show that storing carbon in fast-growing biogenic materials is much more efficient than in timber elements.

This life cycle assessment follows the ISO 14040/44 methodology, considering the construction, operation, maintenance and demolition stages. The reference unit of this study is defined as ‘one useful square meter university dormitories with 50 years life time’. This study estimates the life cycle inventory by: 1) tenders information of university dormitories built in the university town of Fuzhou during 2007–2011, 2) water and energy bills of those building over past 5 years, 3) damage and maintenance report of dormitories in Fuzhou University and Fujian University of traditional Chinese medicine during 2004–2014. The Ecoinvent database provides the background data to the analysis. The results indicate that 1) the use stage, including operation and maintenance is the dominate part of the life cycle environmental impacts and cost of university dormitories. 2) The consumption of electricity constitutes the main elements causing the environmental impacts over the life cycle of university dormitories. The technology for more energy efficient building is more important than other factors. 3) The window, concrete, steel, and cement have the largest contribution to the embodied environmental impacts but with the relative small contribution to the life cycle cost. Therefore, two main improving opportunities for reducing the environmental impacts of Chinese university dormitories development are identified: 1) improving building with deep renovation for current dormitories and implementing low energy buildings standards for new built dormitories the buildings energy efficiency and 2) increasing the use of low environmental impacts building material by implementing the carbon tax on main building material and introducing timbers as structure material.

The prefabrication approach has been promoted and increasingly integrated into building engineering and construction, which has attracted increasing research into the life-cycle carbon assessment (LCCA) of prefabricated buildings. However, there exist challenges. This paper examines the challenges and, through rethinking their theoretical fundamentals, proposes solutions with the aim to enhance the reliability and validity of research into the LCCA of prefabricated buildings. The challenges are found to be implicit system boundaries of prefabrication and LCCA: inconsistent methods, models and units of analysis of estimating buildings' life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions and LCCA being a labour-intensive process with limited accountability. The proposed solutions are a regression model of relating buildings' LCCA to 12 system boundaries, expressed by the system boundaries' inconsistency ratio (I R), which shows the level of difference between any two system boundaries; a five-level framework of units of analysis consisting of material, component, assembly, flat and building; and a smart-technology-integrated approach for automatic LCCA. The solutions are important and timely to help reduce buildings' life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions effectively for achieving long-term sustainability of society.","buildings, structures &amp; design | energy | sustainability",15,0,,,,undefined,Technion-Israel Institute of Technology

According to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate projections that temperature and carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere are likely to increase significantly by the end of this century. These changes may cause an acceleration of carbonation-induced deterioration processes and consequently a decline of the safety, serviceability and durability of concrete infrastructure. Carbonation-induced deterioration of Reinforced Concrete (RC) bridge decks under a changing climate is investigated in this study. Two latest IPCC climate projection scenarios, i.e. RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 emission scenarios, are used here representing possibly high and medium greenhouse gas emission scenarios. The spatial time-dependent reliability analysis is used to include not only the uncertainty of climate projections, deterioration processes and predictive models, but also the spatial variability in material properties and dimensions. The likelihood and extent of corrosion damage is estimated by tracking the evolution of the corrosion process across a bridge deck using Monte Carlo Simulations, and it is more or less affected by the changing climate depending on locations. Case studies of RC bridge decks are presented considering effects of construction methods, climate conditions and design specifications for Australian and Chinese bridges.

The objective is to provide environmental decision criteria as well as scientific data able to be incorporated in a whole building LCA. Results reveal that the environmental impact of carbon-fibre production is greater than that of steel. Nevertheless, the whole CFRP reinforcement has a better environmental behaviour compared to steel/epoxy due to the mechanical properties of CFRP that leads to a reduction of the required material.

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been increasingly used to assess the environmental impacts of construction products and buildings and a new trend is characterized by the application of LCA to larger systems such as neighborhoods during early design phases. Assessing urban development projects at the master-planning stage raises the issue of inventory data collection, especially for building materials which are reported to account for about 20% of primary energy consumption in buildings, and up to 45% of associated greenhouse gas emissions. Urban planners focus on the urban morphology and little information is known about the buildings characteristics apart from their general shape. This paper proposes a simplified model for the assessment of buildings embodied energy and embodied carbon in relation with urban planners’ design levers. The model relies on the decomposition of buildings into functional elements in order to be sensitive to the shape of the buildings. A detailed sensitivity analysis and contribution analysis of the model is conducted on two types of generic building forms, in order to investigate the influence of parameters relating to shape on the embodied energy and embodied carbon of a building. The sensitivity analysis shows that the parameters relating to shape (such as the dimension of the buildings) are more influential on the embodied energy and embodied carbon per square meter of building than the ones relating to the elements themselves (such as the wall thickness). The contribution analysis also brings evidence of the relation between the compactness factor and the embodied energy and embodied carbon of a building.",Building modelling | Building shape | Contribution analysis | Embodied carbon | Embodied energy | Life cycle assessment | Neighborhood scale | Sensitivity analysis,26,0,,,,ANR-10-IEED-0013,IIlinois State Museum

Additionally, the structural design of the façade was also investigated through a structural optimisation procedure which takes into account all relevant loads and ensures minimal use of the structural material.

However, most of these tools have been primarily focused on building-scale modelling and evaluation, leaving the emissions related to infrastructure and occupant activities as well as the carbon offsetting from implementing district-scale renewable energy systems, often neglected. The uptake of macro perspective carbon evaluations at the urban precinct level has been slow due to various barriers such as system boundary definition, quantification of complex inter-building effects, availability of comparable data, integrated modelling and uncertainties related to occupants’ life styles. This research developed an integrated life-cycle model to support the precinct-scale evaluation of carbon footprint for a comprehensive understanding of the emission profile. This is expected to further support low carbon planning and (re)development of urban precincts. The model structure is underpinned by four major components at the precinct level, i.e. embodied, operational and travelling associated carbon emissions, as well as the carbon offsetting from solar energy harvesting. The utility of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through preliminary case studies on representative suburban precincts in Adelaide, South Australia. Comparative studies and scenario analysis are also involved to identify the critical elements affecting the overall carbon performance of urban precincts.",Carbon offsetting | Integrated modelling | Inter-building effects | Life-cycle emissions | Precinct,19,0,,,CRC,RP2007,CRC Health Group

The method of life-cycle assessment can help to compare and assess the environmental performance of building products. At present, more than 70% of all sawn timber in South Africa is used in buildings, mainly in roof structures. Light gauge steel trusses have recently also been gaining market share. However, to date, no studies have been conducted that quantify and compare the environmental impacts of the different roof truss systems in South Africa. We thus compared several roof truss systems (South African pine, Biligom and light gauge steel) found in low- and medium-income house designs in South Africa using a simplified life-cycle assessment approach. Our results show that the two timber systems had overall the lowest environmental impact. Although the difference between the timber systems was small, light gauge steel had a 40% higher normalised impact over all assessed environmental impact categories. The benefit of biogenic carbon dioxide present in timber proved to play a significant positive role in the global warming potential impact and could even be further reduced if wood were used to generate energy at its end-of-life. This study demonstrates the potential advantage of using local timber products to reduce the environmental impact of the truss and building industry in South Africa.

A set of three low-carbon, socio-technical transition pathways were developed and analysed via an innovative collaboration between engineers, social scientists and policy analysts. The pathways focus on the power sector, including the potential for increasing use of low-carbon electricity for heating and transport, within the context of critical European Union developments and policies. Their development started from narrative storylines regarding different governance framings, drawing on interviews and workshops with stakeholders and analysis of historical analogies. The quantified UK pathways were named Market Rules, Central Co-ordination and Thousand Flowers; each reflecting a dominant logic of governance arrangements. The aim of the present contribution was to use these pathways to explore what is needed to realise a transition that successfully addresses the so-called energy policy 'trilemma,' i.e. the simultaneous delivery of low carbon, secure and affordable energy services. Analytical tools were developed and applied to assess the technical feasibility, social acceptability, and environmental and economic impacts of the pathways. Technological and behavioural developments were examined, alongside appropriate governance structures and regulations for these low-carbon transition pathways, as well as the roles of key energy system 'actors' (both large and small). An assessment of the part that could possibly be played by future demand side response was also undertaken in order to understand the factors that drive energy demand and energy-using behaviour, and reflecting growing interest in demand side response for balancing a system with high proportions of renewable generation. A set of interacting and complementary engineering and techno-economic models or tools were then employed to analyse electricity network infrastructure investment and operational decisions to assist market design and option evaluation. This provided a basis for integrating the analysis within a whole systems framework of electricity system development, together with the evaluation of future economic benefits, costs and uncertainties. Finally, the energy and environmental performance of the different energy mixes were appraised on a 'life-cycle' basis to determine the greenhouse gas emissions and other ecological or health burdens associated with each of the three transition pathways. Here, the challenges, insights and opportunities that have been identified over the transition towards a low-carbon future in the United Kingdom are described with the purpose of providing a valuable evidence base for developers, policy makers and other stakeholders.",demand side response | electricity network modelling | energy and environmental appraisal | historical insights | interdisciplinarity | low-carbon technologies | socio-technical systems | techno-economic modelling | technology assessment | Transition pathways | United Kingdom | whole systems analysis,40,1,repositoryam,Green,EPSRC,EP/K002252/1,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council

Out of the six case studies, one building was completely redesigned as per current codes using wood as the major structural material. Bills of materials for both wood redesigns and the as-built designs were used as input in the software and subsequently analyzed. Results showed that the average reduction in GWP due to wood substitution was about 60% across the six case studies.

First, the role of construction and material manufacturing is evaluated within the full life cycle energy and CO2 emissions of a building, concluding that the issue of embodied energy justifies the use of less energy intensive materials. Then the article reviews the literature dealing with the energy requirements of wood based construction, in order to establish whether the use of this natural, low density construction material is more energy efficient than using brick, reinforced concrete and steel structures. According to our analysis, the vast majority of the studies found that the embodied energy is significantly lower in wood based construction when compared to inorganic materials. According to several authors, wood construction could save much energy and significantly reduce the emissions related to the building sector on the national level. Carbon sequestration, and the related mitigation of the global climate change effect, can be significant if the share of durable wooden buildings can be increased in the market, using sustainably produced raw materials that are handled responsibly at the end of their lifetime. Some conflicting studies make important points concerning the heat storage, recycling and on-site labour demands related to these structures.

The analysis encompassed the whole life cycle but the end of life, due to the lack of reliable data for this stage. The production phase of the raw materials was identified as the main source of environmental impacts, but the transport distance of raw materials, as well as the amount and composition of the binder mixture, can considerably affect the results. An experimental assessment (via X-ray Powder Diffraction analysis) of the carbonation process taking place within the binder during the use phase of the wall showed that the carbonation rate may be smaller than assumed in previous works: after 240 d, only the outermost layers of the blocks showed significant levels of carbonation, while the innermost layers experienced only a negligible increase in the amount of carbonates. Nevertheless, the overall emission balance is very favourable: thanks to biogenic CO2 uptake during hemp growth and to CO2 uptake by carbonation, hempcrete blocks have a negative carbon footprint and act therefore as effective carbon sinks.",Carbonation | CO  uptake 2 | Hempcrete | Life cycle assessment | Natural building material,107,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

As operational energy consumption in buildings falls, due to continued tightening of regulations and improvements in the efficiency of energy generation and distribution, present inefficiencies in embodied energy use become increasingly significant in the calculation of whole life energy use. The status quo cannot continue if we are to meet carbon emissions reduction targets. We must now tackle embodied energy as vigorously as we have tackled operational energy in buildings in the past. Current design methods are poorly suited to controlling material inefficiency in design, which arises as a risk mitigation strategy against unknown loads and uncertain human responses to these loads. Prescriptive codes are intended to result in buildings capable of providing certain levels of performance. These performance levels are often based on small tests, and the actual performance of individual building designs is rarely fully assessed after construction. A new approach is required to drive the minimisation of embodied energy (lightweighting) through the collection of performance data on both structures and their occupants. This paper uses an industry facing survey to explore for the first time the potential use of performance measurement to create new drivers for lighter and more usable designs.

However, the compilation of these data can be tiresome and complicated. To engage farmers in the LCA, a web tool (eFoodPrint Env®) was designed to facilitate their tasks as much as possible, seeking the trade-off between comprehensiveness and time consumption without affecting the quality. Methods: The model relies on primary data for the specific parcel and growing season; it starts with the ancillary materials extraction and ends with the transport of products to the corresponding cooperative. The model excludes the infrastructure except in the cases of protected crops including greenhouses. To build the inventory, the web tool guides the user through a questionnaire divided in cultivation, machinery, fertilization, plant treatment, and transport. Carbon footprint is computed with global warming potentials of the International Panel of Climate Change following the norm PAS2050. The calculations behind the web tool have the following modules: (1) farming input and output flows; (2) database and default data; (3) greenhouse infrastructure; (4) impact assessment; (5) uncertainty analysis, and (6) results module. Results and discussion: The web tool is already in use and can be applied to most of agricultural facilities. Examples of estates of corn, nectarine, grape, and tomato are herein showed. The application displays the results distributed in the different stages considered in each product system, and the scores include error bars derived from the uncertainty analysis. Corn production showed the highest carbon footprint per kilogram of product, with a high contribution due to fertilizer production and application. The carbon footprint of tomato production in low-tunnel greenhouse showed nearly 30 % of impact related only to the greenhouse structure. Regarding uncertainty, the worst value is also associated to the corn production for which the most uncertain activities have more influence (fertilizer and transport). Conclusions: The design of the tool has the objective of meeting the requirements of data quality and comprehensiveness with the reality of the farms. The tool is generic enough to be applied to different cropping systems, enabling the generation of simple reports with the results of the analysis.

Based in Singapore, this is one of the first studies in the literature that applies both attributional and consequential life cycle approaches to compare the global warming potential and embodied energies of these two materials, which are widely used for the structural parts of buildings. It was found that 1 kilogram (kg) of steel can be replaced by 1 or 4.25 kg of reinforced concrete. Two consequential scenarios for each of three combinations of primary and secondary steel were assessed. It was found that reinforced concrete produces less carbon dioxide emissions and incurs less embodied energy in most of these cases, but when different sustainable primary steel-making technologies were incorporated, these results may be reversed. We applied consequential life cycle assessment and scenario analysis to describe how changes in the demand for structural steel and reinforced concrete in Singapore's building industry give rise to different environmental impacts. Specifically, the consequential life cycle approach revealed that, over the short term, the impact of substituting steel with reinforced concrete depends on the difference in impacts resulting from the transportation of these two materials within Singapore. Based on these lessons, integrated technology policies to improve the overall sustainability of using steel for construction were proposed.",attributional life cycle assessment (ALCA) | cement | concrete | consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) | industrial ecology | steel,23,0,,,NUS,R296-000-137-112,National University of Singapore

Reduction of embodied carbon in buildings becomes important in the context of limiting GHG emissions into atmosphere. However, previous studies focused on analysis of low-rise buildings while high-rise buildings were seldom evaluated. Therefore, this study aims to develop a method used for the quantification and analysis of embodied carbon in high-rise buildings. The proposed method is used to evaluate the impacts of different procurement strategies (e.g., the choice of material manufacturing processes, the amounts of recycled steel scrap and cement substitutes, and the source locations), based on a case study of embodied carbon for a 60-story composite core-outrigger reference building (i.e., the most commonly-used structure in high-rise building design). The results show that structural steel and rebar from traditional blast furnace account for 80% of the embodied carbon in the core-outrigger building, while ready-mixed concrete contributes only 20%. If steel is produced from electric arc furnace with 100% recycled steel scrap as the feedstock, the embodied carbon of the building can be reduced by over 60%. As for ready-mixed concrete, 10–20% embodied carbon reduction in buildings can be achieved by utilizing cement substitutes (35% fly ash or 75% slag). However, using concrete with large amounts of cement substitutes has longer setting periods and affects the construction time. In projects with strict construction schedules, contractors may use less cement substitutes, leading to increased embodied carbon emissions in buildings. When large amounts of recycled steel and cement substitutes are used in construction, the carbon emissions from transportation can increase up to 20% of the embodied carbon in a building. In such cases, a trade-off analysis considering both the embodied carbon and the material availability is needed in order to determine the optimal source locations.",Construction material | Embodied carbon | Green procurement | High-rise building | Life cycle assessment | Low carbon building,75,0,,,,undefined,

The early design stage, the most critical time for assessing a building's sustainability is particularly important in making decisions on building materials, which highly affect the sustainable performance of the final product. This paper presents a framework for developing a sustainability assessment tool for buildings in a computerized environment using life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The embodied carbon and life cycle cost represent the environmental and economic pillars of sustainability in applying multi-criteria decision making approach to estimate the 'Building Sustainability Index'. Although the contribution of operational carbon dominates the total life cycle carbon of a conventional building, the importance of embodied carbon is increasing due to the energy saving technology and change in energy consumption behavior. Integration of the economic criteria in the form of life cycle cost provides a more balanced approach to sustainability assessment. The initial input is provided by an Autodesk Revit building model and the interactive sustainability assessment tool is developed using Visual Studio C# Object Oriented Programming language in the.NET framework, which is integrated with a Structured Query Language (SQL) database. The database is created by using existing databases such as Inventory of Carbon and Energy (ICE), relevant data from previous research and field data from building contractors, material manufacturers and equipment suppliers, especially in the context of South Asia. Using the proposed tool, various material combinations for a building design can be evaluated in terms of 'Building Sustainability Index', facilitating decision makers in selecting the optimum combination of building materials in terms of environmental and economic sustainability.",building materials | embodied carbon | life cycle assessment | life cycle cost | sustainability assessment,10,1,publisherfullgold,Gold,,2015BAK33B04,

In this paper we explored a monetization method to convert the life cycle environmental impact into a life cycle environmental cost to address the temporal issues involved in LCA by discounting. This method can facilitate decision-making when tradeoffs between current and future environmental impacts exist. Moreover, this method can be used as an effective supplement to life cycle cost and provide decision support for making trade-off between cost and environmental impact. Finally, a building located in Xiamen City, China was selected as a case study and analyzed by the proposal LCA method. The results indicated that carbon cost in the operational stage is the maximum, building material production and transportation stages are ranked second, and the amount in the demolition stage is negligible, compared with the other three stages. Additionally, with the increase of the discount rate, the carbon cost in different life cycle stages will decrease, the percentage of the carbon cost in the operational stage will gradually decrease, but the percentage of the carbon cost in building material production and transportation stages will gradually increase.",Building | Discounting | Life cycle assessment | Monetarization | Time dependent,16,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In the case of high-rise hotel buildings, this problem is further added to by the low levels of safety in the case of fire. The development of tourism in the 1950s and 60s led to the construction of a large number of high-rise hotels with 30+ floors. Initially, they conformed to lax, undemanding regulations regarding fire resistance in their structural components, fire escape routes, protected staircases, and so on. The requirements of today's regulations in this field, contained in the Basic SI Technical Building Code Document, often make the renovation of these buildings an impossible task.

The Pier has been in service for over 70 years without any significant repair or maintenance activities. The aim of this study was to understand the environmental and economic implications of selecting nickel-containing stainless steel reinforcement using the Progreso Pier as the case study. Methods: A combined environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) study was conducted. The analysis considered the potential environmental impacts and the net present cost of the stainless steel reinforced structure from cradle to grave and compared it to the same structure using conventional carbon steel. Results and discussion: The results indicated that while using stainless steel reinforcement resulted in a marginally higher environmental impact after initial construction, this is offset by the increased service life and, hence, less frequent maintenance and reconstruction activities. Relative to the as-built stainless steel reinforcement design, the environmental impacts of the carbon steel reinforced design are between 69 and 79 % higher over the analysis period. Similar observations were made for the other investigated impact categories. The cost implications of using stainless steel reinforcement show economic benefits that are complementary to the environmental benefits. Similar to the LCA, the service life benefits outweigh the higher unit costs for stainless steel, assuming a discount rate of 0.01 % as the baseline scenario. The carbon steel reinforced design has a net present cost that is 44 % higher than the as-built stainless steel reinforcement design. The crossover point for the two designs occurs at year 50, which corresponds to the reconstruction activity. A sensitivity analysis shows that the results and conclusions are sensitive to the choice in discount rate: Rates 3 % and lower produce net present costs that are lower for the as-built design; rates 4 % and higher produce net present costs that are lower for the alternative design. Conclusions: The study demonstrates how LCA and LCC are complementary tools that can be used in decision-making for sustainable construction. The Progreso Pier exemplifies the importance of considering the entire life cycle with service life and recycling as well as long-term life cycle impacts of infrastructure projects from an environmental and economic perspective.",LCA | LCC | Life cycle assessment | Life cycle costing | Life cycle thinking | Stainless steel | Sustainable construction,33,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,

In recent years, the percentage of embodied carbon dioxide in the whole life cycle impact of buildings has been increasing while innovations have lowered operational carbon dioxide. Operational carbon dioxide emissions are due to heating, cooling, ventilation and lighting, whereas embodied carbon dioxide is associated with materials extraction, manufacturing, transportation, construction, maintenance and demolition. Limited research on the latter prevents an accurate evaluation of the whole life cycle impact of buildings. Therefore, leading engineers have emphasised the urgent need for a global, standard assessment method for embodied carbon dioxide. To this end, this paper offers a uniform method by describing current work, quantifying material weights and finally calculating embodied carbon dioxide ranges. The approach is cradle-to-gate but can be expanded to cradle-to-grave. The survey contains data on 200 recently completed buildings obtained from industry. The results show that structural material quantities vary between 200 kg/m2 and 1800 kg/m2 and embodied carbon dioxide caries on the range 150-600 kgCO2e/m2. These numbers are analysed by programme type, structural system, size, number of floors and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (Leed) certification. In doing so, the paper emphasises the important role that structural engineers play in sustainability.","Buildings, Structures &amp; design | Environment | Sustainability",48,0,,,,undefined,

This study is based on the theory of the social cost of carbon, with an adequately demonstrated social cost of carbon and social discount rate. Taking into consideration both static and dynamic situations and using a social discount rate of 3.5%, the total life-cycle carbon emission flows, absolute carbon emission and building carbon costs were calculated and assessed. The results indicated that concrete structures had the highest embodied carbon emission flows and negative carbon emission flows in the waste and reclamation stage. Wood structures that started the life-cycle with stored carbon had the lowest carbon emission flows in the operations stage and relatively high negative carbon emission flows in the reclamation stage.

The results showed that the estimated energy footprint obtained using ELP-s was close in value to that produced by GaBi and SimaPro, but that carbon footprint was much lower with ELP-s. This great deviation in carbon footprint can be explained by the lower GHG emissions intensity per unit energy in Sweden compared with the world average or European average, the major data sources on which estimations in GaBi and SimaPro are based.

About 40 % of all primary energy is used in buildings all over the world. This paper is the second part of the study on the life-cycle energy (LCEA), emissions (LCCO2A) and cost (LCCA) assessment of two residential buildings constructed in urban and rural areas. Methods: In the first part, the methodology, formulations and procedure for such a comprehensive analysis are provided, while this paper provides an application of the methodology that considers two actual buildings located in Gaziantep, Turkey. The proposed model focused on building construction, operation and demolition phases to estimate energy use, carbon emissions and costs per square meter over a 50-year lifespan. The optimum thickness of insulation used to reduce energy consumption and emissions per square meter is determined. Results and discussion: It is found that the operating phase is dominant in both urban and rural residential buildings and contributes 87–85 % of the primary energy requirements and 88–82 % of CO2 emissions, respectively. Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions were 5.8 and 3.9 tons CO2 eqv. for BT1 and BT2, respectively. It is calculated that the life-cycle energy consumption and CO2 emissions of the residential buildings can be reduced by up to 22.8 and 23.4 %, respectively, by using a proper insulation material for the external walls. The life-cycle cost, consisting of mortgage, energy, maintenance, service and demolition payments are calculated to be 7.28 and 1.72 million USD for BT1 and BT2, respectively. Conclusions: Building envelope developments, such as better wall insulation, provide noteworthy potential energy savings and contribute to the reductions from cooling and space heating. Therefore, primary strategies and technologies needed for efficient buildings include optimal insulation of external walls. The economic insulation thickness of the residential buildings in Gaziantep is determined to be 80 mm by using a life-cycle cost analysis. The results show that because of the differences in building structures and living standards, life-cycle energy intensity and CO2 emissions in urban residential buildings are 29 and 25 % higher than in rural conditions.",Greenhouse gas emissions | Life-cycle cost analysis | Life-cycle energy analysis | Residential buildings,33,0,,,,undefined,Gaziantep Üniversitesi

The iron and steel is an industry of high energy consumption, high pollution and high emissions which has attracted deep concern of Chinese government. Previous research has estimated the direct CO2 emissions in individual processes of iron and steel production, while research on the indirect CO2 emissions from the related sectors of the iron and steel industry is scarce. To explore the whole CO2 emissions, this paper evaluates the direct and indirect carbon emissions in the iron and steel industry and carbon emission deduction by building an economic input–output life cycle assessment (EIO-LCA) model based on the latest available data of the input–output extension table in 2010 and China’s Energy Statistical Yearbook in 2011. The results show that coke and coal produce the most direct CO2 emissions and raw chemical materials, medical and chemical fiber manufacturing, transportation storage and the postal industry, the electricity heat production and supply industry, nonmetal mineral production, petroleum processing of coke and nuclear fuel processing, coal mining and dressing are the six sectors that produce the largest indirect CO2 emissions among the 35 sectors in the iron and steel industry.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is applied to compare the climate change impact (CC) of a reinforced concrete (RC) benchmark structure to the CC of an alternative timber structure for four buildings ranging from 3 to 21 storeys. The timber structures are dimensioned to meet the same load criteria as the benchmark structures. The LCA comprises three calculation approaches differing in analysis perspective, allocation methods, and modelling of biogenic CO2 and carbonation of concrete. Irrespective of the assumptions made, the timber structures cause lower CC than the RC structures. By applying attributional LCA, the timber structures are found to cause a CC that is 34-84% lower than the RC structures. The large span is due to different building heights and methodological assumptions. The CC saving per m2 floor area obtained by substituting a RC structure with a timber structure decrease slightly with building height up to 12 storeys, but increase from 12 to 21 storeys. From a consequential LCA perspective, constructing timber structures can result in avoided GHG emissions, indicated by a negative CC.

Are recycled construction materials more environmental than virgin materials? To estimate which alternative construction solution has the smallest carbon footprint, a survey was made for the school model used for the reconstruction programme in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. Design/methodology/approach: The carbon footprint was calculated using life cycle assessment methodology for five different concrete structure alternatives and five different cement mixes for the same design of a school building. In addition, the uptake of CO2 through the carbonation of concrete during 50 years was calculated. Findings: The carbon footprint of recycled materials can be either the best or worst option, depending on how the materials are used. The difference to using virgin materials is not big. This is mainly due to the lower structural performance of recycled materials, which needs to be compensated for by using additional reinforcements. Using cement mixes that have high amounts of substitutes for cement seems to lower the carbon footprint of structures considerably. The uptake of CO2 in carbonation has potential but requires an optimal design and environment. Originality/value: The findings give information for humanitarian project managers and designers on lowering the carbon footprint of their construction projects.",Built environment | Case studies | Climate change | Construction materials | Post disaster reconstruction | Sustainable construction,3,0,,,,undefined,

With the advancement of innovations in technology and energy conservation policies, emissions related to energy production and use as well as the production of building materials have been reducing in China. Consequently, this will influence the environmental performance of buildings indirectly. In this study, the life cycle carbon footprint of residential buildings in Beijing was calculated for the past 20 years, based on life cycle inventory databases in the context of energy and building materials, to determine the change in environmental performance of residential buildings. The results show that the carbon footprint in Beijing exhibited a decreasing trend, mainly as a result of carbon reduction in the energy mix and improvements in the building material production system. The carbon footprints of different structures also exhibited decreasing trends, although they varied in numbers. Considering life cycle stages, the use phase of buildings dominated the carbon footprint profile, which is mainly attributed to energy use. Although energy saving in the use phase was strongly correlated to the reduction of the carbon footprint of buildings, it had a limit in context of both economic cost and environmental cost. The coordination of various industrial sectors, such as energy production and material production industries should be paid sufficient attention while making policies for carbon reduction. Furthermore, as shown by the results, it is necessary to integrate the time parameter in life cycle assessment more efficient sustainable environmentalmanagement.

The analysis is applied to a pilot net zero emission building (nZEB) called the Living Laboratory, which has been developed by the Norwegian Research Centre on Zero Emission Buildings. The impact of embodied emissions is presented through a series of sensitivity analyses that consider the definition of a functional unit and system boundary. The results for embodied emissions are presented for each building component, and highlight important design drivers for the reduction of emissions in building construction. Compared to the previous ZEB projects, the total embodied emission result from the Living Laboratory of 23.5kgCO2eq/m2/yr is considered high. This is due to the building having a more comprehensive material inventory, which includes more life cycle phases, and uses a higher level of technical equipment and state-of-The-Art materials. The results show that the outer roof, photovoltaic system and outer walls drive the highest emissions. Further analysis revealed that in some cases high emissions came from the production phase, whereas in other cases it originated from the replacement phase. The results show that timber, electrical components and metal were responsible for driving the highest emissions. The results show that certain design choices, such as a change in foundation design, can reduce embodied emissions by 21%, which could be further reduced if low carbon concrete was used.",Design drivers | Design process | Embodied emissions | Net zero emission buildings,4,0,,,,undefined,

Accordingly, this paper will discuss a simple EEC calculation method undertaken at an early stage of the design process. This method proposes applying appropriate intensities to major selected building items. It also indicates that setting intensities per quantity of major materials/equipment, per gross floor area and per estimated cost would enable calculation of the EEC with relatively high accuracy. The EEC of the sample building was obtained by both the simple calculation and detailed calculation methods, in order to confirm the accuracy of the former calculation.

A life cycle assessment (LCA) approach compares two specific environmental impact categories: global warming potential (GWP) and abiotic resource depletion potential (ARDP). A number of ecodesign measures were examined for each installation: powerhouse structure, concrete selection, roofing materials, excavation work and transportation. Ecodesign led to cumulative savings of between 2.1% and 10.4% for GWP, and ARDP savings of between 0.1% and 2.6%, for the hydropower installations. Small savings were made with each ecodesign measure applied in all case studies. Furthermore, applying a 1% materiality threshold as outlined by LCA standards was shown to under-estimate the total project burdens, and to neglect opportunities for burden savings through ecodesign. Ecodesign can promote the use of locally sourced materials and some measures can lead to time savings during the construction process.

A variety of methods have been proposed, one of the most common being the replacement of cement as a binder in concrete with supplementary cementitious materials, such as fly ash (FA), which can have lower environmental effects. The use of FA can change the kinetics of the hydration reactions and, consequently, modify the evolution of the concrete strength over time. Yet the influence of designing structural elements to obtain the required strength at later ages has not been examined in terms of their influence on global warming potential (GWP) of concrete. This research investigates the influence of design age, in addition to mix proportions and geometric aspects, on the GWP associated with making beams, columns, and a concrete building frame. Findings suggest that while the GWP for beams is not highly dependent on concrete mixture strength, the GWP for columns is dependent on strength, thus the influence of required strength at later ages influences GWP of making columns more so than beams. For the concrete frame analyzed, a potential 45% reduction in GWP, depending on mix proportions and design age, was found. Using the findings from this research, the GWP associated with production of concrete in California could be reduced by approximately 1.8 million metric tons of CO2-eq emissions, equivalent to approximately 2% of all industrial GHG emissions in California.",compressive strength | concrete design age | fly ash (FA) | global warming potential (GWP) | life cycle assessment (LCA),53,1,repositoryvor,Green,,undefined,

In the construction sector, FRP are mainly used for strengthening existing buildings, thus creating the possibility of avoiding the environmental problems resulting from demolishing these structures and constructing new ones. In the light of this new opportunity, the present paper aims at evaluating and comparing the environmental performances of an unstrengthened reinforced concrete (RC) beam with those of different carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) flexural strengthening techniques. Methods: The paper uses Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology in order to determine the most environmentally friendly solution in the case of an existing RC beam which does not properly satisfy the structural demands. The authors have decided to use the Cradle-to-Gate LCA type of study, considering that the primary goal of the paper is to establish whether strengthening and reusing an existing RC beam can be considered a more viable environmentally friendly proposal in contrast with demolishing the existing structural element and constructing a new one. The following impact categories are used with the purpose of achieving a clear understanding of the products’ environmental influence: Climate Change, Human Toxicity, and Ozone Depletion. Their environmental performances are evaluated using the GaBi 6 software. Results and discussion: The obtained results show that all the assessed CFRP strengthening solutions have a significantly lower environmental impact in comparison with those of the RC beam. In the case of the analysed RC structural element, the highest impact is attributed to the manufacturing stage of the cement and to the steel reinforcements. In most of the CFRP strengthening schemes, the environmental impact is mainly influenced by the amount of component materials (fibre and resin) used for manufacturing the considered composite elements. Conclusions: The resulted values for the environmental parameters in the assessed case studies encourage the authors to assert that the usage of composite materials in specific civil engineering applications can represent an environmentally friendly solution. The environmental aspect of sustainability can thus be achieved in this industry by using particular FRP strengthening applications. Moreover, the negative effects of modern society over Earth can be reduced. The paper concludes that the usage of composite materials can represent an important step towards the sustainable development of the construction sector.",CFRP | Construction sector | Cradle-to-grave | Environmental impact | LCA | RC beam | Sustainability,24,0,,,,undefined,

Most of the aging bridges are in need of strengthening, which will lead to consuming big amounts of material and energy resources, producing air emissions and solid waste. This paper made a life cycle assessment for a highway bridge with four different strengthening plans by using Eco-indicator 99 to figure a total environmental impact score of the bridge. Methods: Based on analyzing the life cycle assessment (LCA) investigations of bridges, the adopted LCA method for the highway bridge tracks materials and energy resources through the various stages of the bridge life cycle including production, transportation, construction, strengthening, and demolition, considering the impact of vehicle detours during strengthening construction, to calculate environmental impact for ecosystem quality, human health, energy, and resources. This is done for four strengthening schemes, which are traditionally compared based only on the basis of economic cost. In order to account for the variability of critical input variables, a Monte Carlo simulation was performed to estimate the variability of environmental scores associated with the transportation distance, the average fuel consumption for each vehicle, detouring distance, the structure closure period, and maintenance times. Ten thousand iterations were conducted based on previous studies. Results and discussion: The analysis shows that the maintenance phase alone contributes about 66 % of the total environmental impact (including detouring stage 50 %, repaving bridge deck 12 %, strengthening 4 %), followed by material production stage (approximately 40 %). Of the four strengthening plans, plan 1 and plan 3 have relatively greater contributions in terms of environmental damage while the cost budgets are much lower. On the contrary, plan 2 and plan 4 have lower environmental burdens but cost much more. Sensitivity analysis shows that the damage to resources and ecosystem quality are more sensitive to the variation of parameters. Conclusions: A life cycle assessment for a highway bridge in China with four different strengthening plans is conducted by using Eco-indicator 99 to figure a total environmental impact score of the bridge. It determines that the maintenance phase contributes the most to the environment deterioration. This study also shows that the energy consumptions and pollutant emissions related to traffic disruption during maintenance operations should not be excluded. Regarding the strengthening plans, it can be concluded that the environmental impact of bonding carbon fiber-reinforced polymer is fewer than that of bonding steel plates.",Bridge engineering | Bridge maintenance | China | Eco-indicator 99 | Environmental impact | Life cycle assessment,43,0,,,,undefined,

Three single family houses built respectively with timber frame, concrete blocks cavity wall, and cast concrete are used as a case study, focusing on the global warming impact category.When biogenic carbon is addressed, the timber house is the less impacting choice, whether it is landfilled or burned at the end-of-life. The cavity wall house is the second most favourable option, and the cast concrete house is the worst one. In the case of landfilling for the timber house, the biogenic carbon balance is not neutral and worth to be considered. When a dynamic approach and specific prospective scenarios are considered, the ranking between houses stays the same, but the gaps between options vary e.g. the gap between the landfilled timber house and the cast concrete house vary from 40 % to 60 % when optimistic changes in the electricity mix are considered.Dynamic LCA allows for a more consistent analysis of emissions flows and global warming impacts over time.

These issues lead to increasing interest in environmental impacts of buildings using various building materials and structural systems. Buildings play a significant role in energy consumption and emission production through all phases of their life cycle. Over the last decade, development toward sustainability has become an important issue in building design decisions. The relative contribution of embodied impacts of building materials and constructions has been recognised as being significant, especially for energy-efficient buildings. Life-cycle assessment as a widely used methodology helps make decisions in sustainable building design. The construction details of the foundation, wall and floor are by far the most significant contribution of embodied impacts associated with the construction phase. The goal of this paper is to assess alternative material solutions for the construction details of foundation, wall and floor to support decisions at the design phase of a project. The selection and combination of the materials influences the amount of energy consumption and associated production of emissions during the operation of the building. Therefore, the thermophysical properties of designed variants of construction details are very significant.

Therefore, the use of concrete road pavements is very limited, despite possible technical and financial benefits. In the present paper, a comparative life cycle assessment was carried out for six different concrete road pavements. The parameters for the comparative LCA were three types of binders; a pozzolanic Portland cement, a new hydraulic road binder and a mixed-type binder consisting of Portland cement and fly ash, as well as two different aggregates; crushed limestone and steel slag. Construction, use and maintenance and end-of-life recycling for a period of 40 years were considered for the life cycle assessment.

Whilst the majority of existing studies have focussed on technical aspects of RER modelling, the proposed framework incorporates financial assessment into the process of appraising the alternatives of hydropower, wind energy and solar energy infrastructures. An approach to the optimal choice of RER deployment for a specific developing region is formulated and applied to Ghana. Design/methodology/approach - A model comprising technical and economic parameters was developed for analysing the investment rankings of different RERs and comparing them to that of conventional energy sources such as the natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) electric plant. The analysis also included the carbon cost and power generation capacity. The total life cycle costing and levelised cost of energy generated from each resource were modelled for three corporate ownership structures: a public utility that is not tax-liable (no-tax case); organisational power generation for internal use, ultimately concerned with its after-tax costs (after-tax case); and an independent power producer for the market, with before-tax revenues covering all costs (before-tax case). Findings - Using the empirical data from Ghana together with the proposed framework, it is shown that when carbon incentives are provided, the hydroelectric and wind conversion infrastructures can effectively compete with the conventional NGCC in this country, whilst with no carbon credit, NGCC still appears to be the most viable option. Practical implications - Policy-related recommendations on carbon incentives and preferential power purchase prices, which are critical for widespread RER deployment, can be directly derived from this research. Originality/value - The study represents a comprehensive decision-making tool that can be used in regulatory and investment analysis on the expansion of RER systems in the developing countries.",CO  emission 2 | Cost comparison | Econometric | Energy balance | Energy production | Energy sector management | Renewable energies | Scenario analysis,2,0,,,,undefined,

To address this, the present study proposes a detailed carbon emission inventory for buildings and divides the life-cycle of a typical building into three stages based on material and energy flow: the materialization stage, the operation stage, and the disposal stage. Additionally, an analytical framework and evaluation indices are established and the proposed methodology is applied to three case studies. The results demonstrate that residential and office buildings with a reinforced concrete block masonry structure could reduce carbon emissions by 38-112kgCO2/m2 compared with either a reinforced concrete structure or a brick-concrete structure. Although the operation stage appears to contribute approximately 82-86% of the total emissions, the materialization stage is also of considerable importance in alleviating the present environmental pressure. Furthermore, possible measures to control carbon during the materialization stage are proposed and evaluated, including optimization design of building structures based on carbon emissions and the selection of insulation materials.

It was found that expanded polystyrene had the lowest environmental impact in fourteen of the sixteen impact categories examined. When applied to a typical dwelling, all three insulation materials demonstrated a net positive benefit over a thirty year life span due to the reduced heating requirements of the building. A study of embodied carbon also included PIR and woodfibre boards. This demonstrated that woodfibre board had the lowest embodied carbon, mainly due to carbon sequestration.

This paper argues that systems analysis and modelling of environmental systems is one necessary part in successful governing of societies towards sustainability. In the 1960th many observations and data made it evident that the environment in most countries was in a bad state. To get a holistic view of the complex problems and to clarify the relationships of structure and function, systems thinking was applied e.g. modelling, cybernetics, systems analysis, life cycle assessment and energy and material flow analysis. Such tools used collectively, conceptualized as 'integrated assessment', can help to communicate fundamental knowledge, and to support decision-making when identifying, developing and implementing precautionary measures and solutions. There are good examples demonstrating the strength of such approaches; Solutions to the ozone depletion by replacing CFC's with more chemically reactive compounds that are degraded within the troposphere. Acidification of European low buffer soils and lakes, sensitive to acid rain, has decreased due to concerted action on Sulphur emission control in large parts of Europe. The handling and recycling of solid waste has resulted in a considerable reduction of deposits in large parts of the world. This basically natural scientific knowledge has also influenced the development within e.g. economy and jurisprudence and today ecological economy and environmental law assume ecological systems as fundamental. The complexity of ecosystems and environmental issues can only be understood by use of advanced scientific tools such as modelling as a base for establishing interdisciplinary co-operation. Each component of such models will of course be an approximation, but validation and verification of the models will serve to make them useful. An ongoing research project at Mid Sweden University aims at building a complete carbon and energy balance model of an entire Swedish region, based on the Danish Samsø-model. Such models will make it possible to refer to a robust scientific base, thereby making it easier to argue for appropriate measures and actions. At the same time it will be clear what data these actions rest upon thereby making it easier to identify possible errors or limitations. Systems analysis and subsequent modes are constructs. According to systems theory and model development they are strategies as the best representations of nature, we can make. At the same time it must be assured, that a continuous adaptation and improvement in a studied area is possible - i.e. that model outcomes are matched with phenomenological observations and that empirical work also is carried out. Model development can therefore be characterized as a dynamic and iterative process. Governance in the Anthropocene will have to understand the problem picture at hand, to learn how to appropriately address increasingly complex issues. For identifying potential solutions and consequences of policy implementation, systems modelling on relevant levels will be one necessary tool. The current project developing an environmental regional model, illustrates how modelling can provide decision support regarding management and energy resources and planning of future infrastructure, as well as serving regional and national information purposes.",Ecological modelling | Governing anthropocene | Integrated assessment | Interdisciplinary cooperation | Regional sustainability,0,0,,,,undefined,

In the life cycle of the building, the carbon emissions are composed of three parts, say embodied carbon, operating carbon and demolition and disposal carbon. Embodied carbon of structural system contributes the most carbon emission during the construction stage of a supper tall building and thus is an important index to measure the environmental impacts of different structural systems for a given super tall building. The embodied carbons and environmental costs of typical super tall building structures for different structural systems are thoroughly analyzed in this study. The distribution of embodied carbons of critical structural members, such as the frame columns, central core walls, structural floors and outrigger trusses are also discussed.

Life cycle assessment analyses are required to design and achieve ""green"" building status. These analyses do not require evaluations of building performance during natural or man-made hazards. Increases in labor and material caused by robust and resilient systems also often increase embodied energy and carbon dioxide emissions. Those LCA analyses which do consider seismic performance of a building many times do not take into account the seismic performance of the non-structural secondary systems (partition walls, drop ceilings, etc.). In the particular case of fire hazards, automatic sprinkler systems add 30-40kg of embodied carbon to a building; however, reduce the risk factor for fire during the life span of a building. To prevent post-fire repairs, which would increase the embodied energy and carbon of the building more, hazard mitigation needs to be integrated with sustainability. The development of performance-based design standards helps this integration; however, the lack of risk factors incorporated into life cycle assessments needs to be remedied, not just for seismic design, but all natural disasters.

However, in most major projects it takes approximately 20 years of operational life before operational carbon exceeds the carbon embodied in the original construction. Minimum acceptance goals for implementation must then be created to encourage a responsible approach to environmental design-one that accounts for carbon emissions from groundbreaking through the building's service life. A tall building, at the time of construction, has a large impact on the environment through the production of building components, delivery, and construction as well as considering life-cycle in areas of abnormal loading (i.e., seismicity). SOM has developed an advanced algorithm called the Environmental Analysis Tool that evaluates embodied carbon as well as cost benefits of enhanced seismic force resisting systems in buildings and infrastructures. An evaluation of embodied carbon in over 200 built structures has revealed trends and correlations among common design parameters such as building height, occupancy type, seismic and wind conditions. This information can be utilized to set design goals and to provide standards for the reduction of embodied carbon through high performance seismic systems such as seismic isolation and pin-fuse devices, as well as ideas including Sustainable Form-Inclusion Systems (SFIS). Finally, an advanced parametric model has been created for new and existing urban developments. The Parametric City Model (PCM) will be used to illustrate the effects of material, construction, and urban density on the environment. Specific national and international tall building examples will be discussed. Buildings will include many of the tallest to date, including the Burj Khalifa, Dubai.

BIM presents the opportunity of electronically modelling and managing the vast amount of information embedded in a building project, from its conception to end-of-life. Researchers have been looking at extensions to expand its scope. Sustainability is one such modelling extension that is in need of development. This is becoming pertinent for the structural engineer as recent design criteria have put great emphasis on the sustainability credentials in addition to the traditional criteria of structural integrity, constructability and cost. With the complexity of designs, there are now needs to provide decision support tools to aid in the assessment of the sustainability credentials of design solutions. Such tools would be most beneficial at the conceptual design stage so that sustainability is built into the design solution starting from its inception. The sustainability of buildings is related to life cycle and is measured using indicator-terms such as life cycle costing, ecological footprint and carbon footprint. This paper proposes a modelling framework combining these three indicators in providing sustainability assessments of alternative design solutions based on the economic and environmental sustainability pillars. It employs the principles of feature-based modelling to extract construction-specific information from product models for the purposes of sustainability analysis. A prototype system is implemented using .NET and linked to the BIM enabled software, Revit Structures™. The system appraises alternative design solutions using multi-criteria performance analysis. This work demonstrates that current process and data modelling techniques can be employed to model sustainability related information to inform decisions right from the early stages of structural design. It concludes that the utilized information modelling representations - in the form of a process model, implementation algorithms and object-based instantiations - can capture sustainability related information to inform decisions at the early stages of the structural design process.",Bim extension | Conceptual design | Feature-based modelling | Sustainability,72,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Nowadays, the society devotes an ever-increased effort to the construction sector regarding their environmental performance.

The paper also examines the effects that discrepancies between two carbon footprint accounting methods (embodied CO2 (ECO2) vs embodied CO2e) have on communication of environmental performance of selected materials. Design/methodology/approach – The lifecycle assessments (LCAs) were performed through LCA support platform SimaPro 7.3. Data for materials/components production cycle modeling were collected from primary and secondary data from national literature or adapted from Ecoinvent database. Embodied energy, ECO2, blue water footprint (bWF), non-renewable content and volatile organic compound emissions (VOCe) indicators were calculated from lifecycle inventory (LCI) outputs, while embodied CO2e was calculated using CML 2001 v.2.01 impact assessment method. Findings – Obtained results suggest that a core database comprised of 12 materials and components – cement, ceramic blocks, steel rebar, sawn timber planks, PVC tubes, plywood, PVC conduits, roof steel structure, roundwood, ceramic tiles, hydrated lime and adhesive mortar – provides a very reasonable description of a building’s embodied energy (99.63 percent), embodied CO2e (97.50 percent), bWF (96.26 percent), non-renewable content (97.53 percent) and VOCe (95.38 percent) profiles. Except for bWF of cement and concrete, substantial reductions in the metrics’ values captured environmental advantages of partially substituting ground granulated blast furnace slag (ggbs) for clinker Portland. Originality/value – The disclosure of embodied energy and carbon, as well as of other environmental performance data at whole-building level (per unit of GFA) pointed out in this paper, allows comparability and helps to establish performance goals and benchmarks and to guide policy decisions. Following a coordinated methodological outline, future works are expected to evolve to gradually constitute a LCI database that enables the use of the proposed metrics and of LCA as decision-making tools in the building sector.",Carbon | Ecoefficiency | Embodied energy | Indicators | Material | Water,13,0,,,CNPq,undefined,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico

Thus, this study concerns the LCA of an environmentally friendly material used for building construction, hemp concrete. The functional unit is first defined per square metre such that the wall may provide the function of bearing wall and its thermal performance is described by a thermal resistance of 2.78m2K/W. The results then showed that the production phase of raw materials is mainly responsible for the environmental impact of the wall, mostly due to the binder production. It was also shown that, compared to traditional construction materials, hemp concrete has a low impact on environment. Moreover, hemp concrete contributes to reduce climate change as photosynthesis-mediated carbon sequestration and carbonation serve to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide. A sensitivity analysis is performed on three criteria: wall thickness, renewal of coatings and compounds of the indoor coating. Our results show that environmental indicators evolve with wall thickness, except for the climate change indicator. It improves with thickness due to carbon sequestration and carbonation. Moreover the increase in the wall's thermal resistance with wall thickness is not taken into account in such an LCA performed at the material level. The renewal of coating slightly impacts the environmental indicator for small numbers of renewals but it leads to negative effects if they are too numerous. It appears that hemp-lime coating has a greater impact than sand-lime coating as it embeds more binder. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Bio-based material | Carbon uptake | Environmental impact indicators | Sprayed hemp concrete | Wood framework,118,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

In this article, a framework for the time-variant seismic sustainability and risk assessment of highway bridge networks is presented. The sustainability of the network is quantified in terms of its social, environmental, and economic metrics. These include the expected downtime, expected energy waste and carbon dioxide emissions, and the expected loss. The methodology considers the probability of occurrence of a set of seismic scenarios that reflect the seismic activity of the region. The performance of network links is quantified based on individual bridge performance evaluated through fragility analyses. The sustainability and risk depend on the damage states of both the links and the bridges within the network following an earthquake scenario. The time-variation of the sustainability metrics and risk due to structural deterioration is identified. The approach is illustrated on a transportation network located in Alameda County, California. © 2014 Copyright A. S.

The selection of building materials used in the structures (floors, walls, roofs, windows, doors, etc.) belongs to one of the most important roles in the phase of building design. This decision has impact on the performance of the building with respect to the criteria of sustainability. The energy used in the extraction, processing and transportation of materials used in building structures can be significant part of the total energy used over the life cycle of building, particularly nearly-zero energy performance buildings. The environmental impacts are expressed by indicators such as embodied energy (EE) from non-renewable resources, embodied CO2-eq emissions (GWP, global warming potential) and embodied SO2-eq emissions (AP, acidification potential) within system boundary from Cradle to Gate. The aim of analysis is identify the environmental quality of material compositions of architectural structure alternatives of exterior wall. The final values of assessments are compared by using methods of multi-criteria decision analysis. The results of the analysis showed that exterior wall designed from ceramic brick and thermal insulation of EPS with graphite can assure the highest reduction of EE by 10% - 37%, of CO2 by 2% - 14%, of SO2 by approximately 10% - 57% in comparison with other alternatives.",Energy and environmental indicators | Thermo-physical parameters | Wall assemblies,4,0,,,EC,052TUKE-4/2013,European Commission

Two structural systems (a traditional timber frame and a light-frame) were compared together with alternate material options for each system. Environmental impacts were determined using the Athena Impact Estimator for Buildings software. Design alterations for generalization were made to an existing timber frame (TF) structure used as the basis of this analysis, and an equivalent light-frame (LF) structure was designed based on the International Residential Code (IRC). Environmental impacts observed include total energy consumption, fossil fuel consumption, global warming potential (GWP), and wood fiber use. All analyses were considered cradle-to-gate, including the manufacturing and construction life-cycle stages. Results show how GWP is linked to both fossil fuel consumption and wood fiber use, and how ultimate environmental impact is driven by energy source. Environmental impacts of structures are driven by material choice, and levels of carbon stored in structural wood serve to decrease GWP. Of the structural assemblies analyzed, the most traditional TF structure outperformed all other options in almost every measure.",Carbon storage | Global warming potential | Life cycle analysis | Wood structures,4,1,publisherhybridgold,Hybrid Gold,,undefined,

Among stainless steels, ferritic and lean duplex grades are characterized by low nickel content resulting in a more cost-stable and economic material compared to austenitic stainless steels. These grades have comparable (or even higher) strength than carbon steel and good corrosion resistance at lower cost. That is why, lately, they have been more often used in structural components. In this paper, attention is first paid to the advantages associated with the use of stainless steel in recent construction projects in view of sustainability. Second, life cycle analysis and the background of the new European standard EN 15804 are introduced, including module D, which allows credits to be taken now for the eventual reuse or recycling of material in the future, at the end-of-life stage. Life cycle inventories of stainless steel products (cold-rolled coils and quarto plate) are presented. Depending on the fraction of material recovered at the end of the lifespan, two potential impacts (Primary Energy Demand and Global Warming Potential) are presented for four grades: 1.4301 (AISI 304) and 1.4401 (AISI 316) austenitic grades, 1.4016 (AISI 430) ferritic grade and 1.4462 (AISI 2205) duplex grade. The influence of module D is underlined. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Life cycle assessment | Recycling | Stainless steel,61,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Various tool are developed to support the application of life cycle assessment (LCA) method. This paper focuses on the carbon emission during the building construction stage. A partial LCA framework is established to assess the carbon emission in this phase. Furthermore, five typical LCA tools programs have been compared and analyzed for demonstrating the current application of LCA tools and their limitations in the building construction stage. Based on the analysis of existing tools and sustainability demands in building, a new computer calculation system has been developed to calculate the carbon emission for optimizing the sustainability during the construction stage. The system structure and detail functions are described in this paper. Finally, a case study is analyzed to demonstrate the designed LCA framework and system functions. This case is based on a typical building in UK with different plans of masonry wall and timber frame to make a comparison. The final results disclose that a timber frame wall has less embodied carbon emission than a similar masonry structure. 16% reduction was found in this study. © 2014 Feifei Fu et al.",,21,1,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

Qatargas, the world's largest LNG producer is improving operational performance and energy efficiency to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions through an effective, well-structured and maturing GHG management strategy. This approach is aligned with the State of Qatar's position on climate change. Qatargas' strategy has three phases. Phase 1 involved understanding the GHG issue, preparing an action plan, and focusing on internal capacity building through analysis of GHG policies, projects and markets. It also analyzed the potential impact of climate change on Qatargas' operations, and reviewed potential opportunities to reduce GHG emissions and participate in the global carbon market. Phase 2 of the GHG strategy focuses on: • Preparing a comprehensive GHG emissions inventory that includes emission sources from various business divisions, development of GHG management procedures and plans, and corporate GHG KPIs; • Benchmarking GHG efficiency per tonne of LNG produced; and • Comparing company GHG performance relative to peer companies. Qatargas' verified emissions inventory portfolio is providing data and trends, which is assisting in the understanding of key emission sources and provides a platform to progress Phase 3 of the GHG strategy. Phase 3 focuses on carbon reduction opportunities and abatement techniques via sustainability assessments and engineering studies; and will also include a Life Cycle Assessment for GHG emissions from Qatargas' operations. These are in addition to the ongoing emissions reduction efforts such as the Flare Management Team initiative and the upcoming Jetty Boil-off Gas Recovery (JBOG) project.

This paper commences with a brief review of the relation of natural hazard performance to sustainability and an assessment of bridge infrastructure sustainability with an emphasis on environmental indicators. A framework for life cycle sustainability analysis (LCS-A) is then posed that elucidates the role of natural hazard risks when evaluating sustainable bridge performance using risk-based indicators of environmental sustainability, including embodied energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Its application provides insight on the sustainability of mitigating damage from natural hazards through retrofitting deficient structures, considering uncertainty in the hazard occurrence, structural performance, and repair or reconstruction actions that affect energy expenditure and emissions. A case study is presented to evaluate indicators of environmental sustainability for individual bridges and for a regional portfolio of bridges susceptible to aging and seismic hazards. The results show the significant impact that retrofit can have on reducing the expected value of emissions and embodied energy from lifetime hazard exposure. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Bridge infrastructure | Environmental impact | Life cycle analysis | Risk assessment | Seismic | Sustainability,85,0,,,,undefined,

Using Phoenix, Arizona light rail as a case study, an integrated transportation and land use life-cycle assessment (ITLU-LCA) framework is developed to assess the changes to energy consumption and air emissions from transit-oriented neighborhood designs. Residential travel, commercial travel, and building energy use are included and the framework integrates household behavior change assessment to explore the environmental and economic outcomes of policies that affect infrastructure. The results show that upfront environmental and economic investments are needed (through more energy-intense building materials for high-density structures) to produce long run benefits in reduced building energy use and automobile travel. The annualized life-cycle benefits of transit-oriented developments in Phoenix can range from 1.7 to 230 Gg CO2e depending on the aggressiveness of residential density. Midpoint impact stressors for respiratory effects and photochemical smog formation are also assessed and can be reduced by 1.2-170 Mg PM10e and 41-5200 Mg O3e annually. These benefits will come at an additional construction cost of up to $410 million resulting in a cost of avoided CO2e at $16-29 and household cost savings. © 2013 American Chemical Society.",,35,0,,,,undefined,

Using the tool, four different construction scenarios are evaluated, representing a range of current construction methods used in present day UK house building. The results show that cradle-to-gate embodied carbon represents 20-26% of the total 60 year carbon emissions, with operational carbon representing 74-80% of total emissions. Construction scenarios that reduce operational carbon by improving the thermal envelope led to a 1-13% increase in embodied carbon but a 4-5% decrease in operational carbon compared to the basecase construction method. Approaches to reduce embodied carbon in new-build housing are also studied and a 24% reduction is demonstrated through building fabric changes. The study recommends that a universally robust methodology for measuring embodied carbon will enable design decisions to be taken to reduce whole life carbon emissions through improved choice of materials. Due to material changes impacting on the thermal characteristics of a dwelling, and to an extent the structural characteristics, an integrated BIM tool will be essential in quickly establishing whole life carbon impacts during the design stage. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Formulas are presented respectively for carbon dioxide emission in each phase after analyzing the detailed lists of carbon dioxide emission for each stage of high-speed railway. Carbon emission characteristics in construction and operation phases are analyzed through examples. Analysis and numerical calculation results show that carbon dioxide emission is relatively higher in construction phase due to the use of lots of construction materials and high energy consumption construction machinery. However, it is reduced considerably after entering operation phase owing to the advantages of high-speed railway, such as saving energy and land as well as freight increment substitution effect, etc. So from the whole life cycle perspective, the effect of carbon dioxide emission reduction of high-speed railway is very good.",Carbon dioxide emission | Environmental protection | High-speed railway | Life cycle,8,0,,,,undefined,

Although quantifying and analyzing the sustainability implications of the built environment is of great importance, it has not been studied sufficiently. Therefore, the overarching goal of this study is to quantify the overall environmental, economic, and social impacts of the U.S. construction sectors using an economic input-output-based sustainability assessment framework. Methods: In this research, the commodity-by-industry supply and use tables published by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, as part of the International System of National Accounts, are merged with a range of environmental, economic, and social metrics to develop a comprehensive sustainability assessment framework for the U.S. construction industry. After determining these sustainability assessment metrics, the direct and indirect sustainability impacts of U.S construction sectors have been analyzed from a triple bottom-line perspective. Results: When analyzing the total sustainability impacts by each construction sector, ""Residential Permanent Single and Multi-Family Structures"" and ""Other Non-residential Structures"" are found to have the highest environmental, economic, and social impacts in comparison with other construction sectors. The analysis results also show that indirect suppliers of construction sectors have the largest sustainability impacts compared with on-site activities. For example, for all U.S. construction sectors, on-site construction processes are found to be responsible for less than 5 % of total water consumption, whereas about 95 % of total water use can be attributed to indirect suppliers. In addition, Scope 3 emissions are responsible for the highest carbon emissions compared with Scopes 1 and 2. Therefore, using narrowly defined system boundaries by ignoring supply chain-related impacts can result in underestimation of triple bottom-line sustainability impacts of the U.S. construction industry. Conclusions: Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies that consider all dimensions of sustainability impacts of civil infrastructures are still limited, and the current research is an important attempt to analyze the triple bottom-line sustainability impacts of the U.S. construction sectors in a holistic way. We believe that this comprehensive sustainability assessment model will complement previous LCA studies on resource consumption of U.S. construction sectors by evaluating them not only from environmental standpoint, but also from economic and social perspectives. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Economic input-output analysis | Life cycle assessment | Sustainability assessment | Triple bottom line | U.S. construction industry,110,0,,,,undefined,

Buildings belong to the largest energy consumers and greenhouse gases emitters. Current energy strategy of European Union is focused especially on reduction of operational energy of buildings. Although operational energy participates the highest proportion in total energy consumption over whole life cycle of building, it is important to take into account embodied energy. Values of embodied energy and associated emissions grow by improving energy quality of building envelope by using extra components and insulation materials. This paper demonstrates significance of correct selection of materials in order to environmental and energy optimalization of building structures. The designed material compositions of external wall alternatives are evaluated by methodology LCA and also in the view of impact on future energy consumption though thermal-physical parameters. Results of assessments are compared by multi-criteria decision analysis. The optimized alternative achieves very low embodied energy (218 MJ/m2) and high reduction of embodied CO2 (-114 kg CO2eq/m2). © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",Building materials | CO  emissions 2 | Embodied energy,1,0,,,,undefined,

This investigation will assist practicing engineers to account for long-term performance and integrate life cycle analysis into design and construction decisions. The design variables considered in this study include the percentage of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) as cement replacement, reinforcing steel cover depth and culvert size. This study proposes the usage of a life-cycle cost assessment approach to compare different culvert designs on an economic basis which accounts for the design variables and the impact of CO2 production and uptake over the life of a culvert from cradle to grave. Analysis of each culvert scenario includes the cost of the initial production of CO2 during the manufacturing process as well as the cost savings that were incurred due to the uptake of CO2 through carbonation processes. Overall, the present cost of the culverts is controlled by the GGBFS content and the reinforcing steel cover depth while carbonation processes have a relatively small economic impact. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",carbonation | concrete infrastructure | culverts | life-cycle cost | pollution | service life,8,0,,,,undefined,

A select few of these opportunities are explored in this article in order to represent possible reduction approaches and their associated cost-effectiveness: reducing embodied emissions by increasing fly ash content and by avoiding overdesign; increasing albedo by using white aggregates; increasing carbonation by temporarily stockpiling recycled concrete aggregates; and reducing vehicle fuel consumption by adding an extra rehabilitation. These reduction strategies are evaluated for interstate, arterial, collector, and local road designs under urban and rural scenarios. The results indicate that significant GHG emission reductions are possible, with over half of the scenarios resulting in 10% reductions, compared to unimproved baseline designs.

The case study deals with possible way to sustainable development of dwelling located in Slovak Republic. The paper focuses on evaluation of energy and environmental performance of the building structures. The energy used in the extraction, processing and transportation of materials used in building structures can be significant part of the total energy used over the life cycle of a building, particularly in nearly-zero energy performance buildings. In order to reduce the embodied energy and embodied carbon, this study is aimed at material selection during the design stage of building. Material selection represents systematic and holistic approach to making decisions and can significantly affect the performance and sustainability of the building during its overall lifetime. For the purpose of optimalisation, it uses the method of multi-criteria analysis. The analysis of material compositions of structure alternatives shows that local available materials on plant base improve environmental potential of building because they lock carbon in their mass and consume solar energy for production of raw material source. The results of LCA (within boundary ""cradle to gate"") demonstrate that in spite of the increased amount of applied materials, the designed nearly zero energy family house with optimised structures achieves approximately 2.6 GJ per floor area and high negative balance of embodied carbon more than -700 kg of CO2eq per floor area and represents possible way to reduce the carbon footprint. © 2013, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,4,0,,,,undefined,

The scope of this article is to explore in what ways responsible and conscious use of materials can yield environmental benefits in buildings. In particular, it discusses how material properties related to thermal and hygroscopic mass can be utilized for achieving energy efficiency and good indoor air quality, and how these gains can be included into the context of life cycle assessment (LCA). A case study investigates and compares carbon impacts related to three design concepts for an exterior wall: (A) concrete/rock wool; (B) wood studs/wood fiber; and (C) wood studs/hemp lime. The thermal performance of concepts B and C are modeled to comply with concept A regarding both thermal transmittance (U-value) and dynamic heat flow (Q24h) using the design tool WUFI Pro. An environmental cost-benefit analysis is then accomplished in four steps, regarding (1) manufacturing and transport loads, (2) carbon sequestration in plant-based materials and recarbonation in concrete/lime, and (3 and 4) potentially reduced operational energy consumption caused by heat and moisture buffering. The input data are based on suggested values and effects found in the literature. The summarized results show that wall A has the highest embodied carbon and the lowest carbon storage and recarbonation effects, whereas wall C2 has the lowest embodied carbon and the highest carbon storage and recarbonation effects. Regarding buffering effects, wall A has the highest potential for thermal buffering, whereas wall C has the highest potential for moisture buffering. © 2013 by Yale University.",Architecture | Carbon sequestration | Energy efficiency | Industrial ecology | Life cycle assessment (LCA) | Materials properties,22,0,,,,undefined,

Alternatively, the I-beam can also be made from composite materials such as glass-reinforced plastics (GRP), which provide similar properties under a lighter weight and a lower cost condition. Nonetheless, their environmental footprint performance depends largely on activities involved during their life cycle. Therefore, the findings are presented in two parts: Part 1 and 2. This paper is about Part 1, which presents the environmental footprint for the cradle-to-grave of one linear metre I-beam that is made from two materials namely stainless steel (316) and GRP. Part 2, which will be submitted as a separate paper, has specifically analysed their environmental and economic impacts for the different cradle-to-gate scenarios and the potential carbon tax. Materials and methods: Materials that were used to compare the environmental footprint of an I-beam are GRP and stainless steel (316). Their cradle-to-grave activities included raw material extraction, supplier transportation, manufacturing process, distribution, disposal transportation and process. Input data were based on data provided by a composites company in Australia, the Ecoinvent 2.2 and Australian data 2007 databases. The World ReCiPe midpoint and endpoint methods were used to assess the environmental footprint. Results and discussion: The environmental footprint results for the cradle-to-grave of the I-beams are presented as a contribution percentage of the single score unit in the total and damage category levels which produced by the endpoint method. The characteristic and normalisation results were also generated for all impact categories by the midpoint method. Conclusions: Overall, the cradle-to-grave results show that the composite I-beam produces 20 % less environmental footprint than that of the stainless steel I-beam. The human health damage category is affected the most due to the main contribution from the material stage. The cradle-to-gate results are contributed by 90 % from raw material extraction, 7 % from the manufacturing process and 3 % from the supplier transportation. In terms of the characteristic results, the composite I-beam produces less environmental impact in most of the impact categories except for the climate change, photochemical oxidant formation, terrestrial acidification, marine eutrophication, natural land transformation and fossil depletion. Therefore, the influential parameters of these impact categories are investigated further in Part 2 where the environmental footprint and economic impact are estimated for different cradle-to-gate scenarios of the I-beams. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Composites | Construction | Cradle-to-grave | Environmental footprint | ReCiPe,25,0,,,,undefined,Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation

Studying these metrics in the context of a regionally limited setting, it was found that utilizing existing infrastructure such as existing building roofs and shade structures does significantly reduce the embodied energy requirements (by 20-40%) and in turn the EPBT of flat-plate PV systems due to the avoidance of energy-intensive balance of systems (BOS) components like foundations. Still, high-efficiency CPV field installations were found to yield the shortest EPBT, the highest ERF and the largest life-cycle CO2 offsets-under the condition that land availability is not a limitation.

Therefore, the appropriate evolution routes of residential buildings need balancing their carbon emission and value creation, which is realized in this paper by creating a new concept of life-cycle carbon efficiency and its relative methodology. First, the life-cycle carbon efficiency of a residential building is defined as the ratio of its life-cycle value to carbon emission, and the life-cycle of a residential building is divided into five stages, including construction materials preparation, building construction, building operation, building demolition, and construction & demolition wastes disposal. Second, the life-cycle carbon emission of a residential building is estimated through calculating the carbon emission at each stage based on its consumed energy and resources. Third, the product of the service life span of a residential building (in year), its building area (m2) and its storey height (m) is recommended to represent its life-cycle value, since this product is a physical measure and more useful to develop action plans to improve its performance. In the end, the proposed methodology is exemplified in estimating the life-cycle carbon efficiency of a five-storey brick-concrete residential building in Nanjing city (China) at its design phase. Possible measures to enhance the estimated carbon efficiency are further put forward, such as prolonging the service life span, enhancing 3R (reduce, reuse and recycle) principles of cement and rolled steel, saving electricity and natural gas at the stage of building operation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Carbon dioxide | Carbon efficiency | Carbon emission | Life-cycle assessment | Residential building | Residential property value,90,0,,,MOE,09YGA790035,Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China

Building authority in Bahrain has set a target of 40% reduction of electricity consumption and associated CO 2 emissions to be achieved by using facade parameters. This work evaluates how the life cycle CO 2 emissions of buildings are affected by facade parameters. The main focus is placed on direct and indirect CO 2 emissions from three contributors, namely, chemical reactions during production processes (Pco 2), embodied energy (Eco 2) and operational energy (OPco 2). By means of the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, it has been possible to show that the greatest environmental impact occurs during the operational phase (80-90%). However, embodied CO 2 emissions are an important factor that needs to be brought into the systems used for appraisal of projects, and hence into the design decisions made in developing projects. The assessment shows that masonry blocks are responsible for 70-90% of the total CO 2 emissions of facade construction, mainly due to their physical characteristics. The highest Pco 2 emissions factors are those of window elements, particularly aluminium frames. However, their contribution of CO 2 emissions depends largely on the number and size of windows. Each square metre of glazing is able to increase the total CO 2 emissions by almost 30% when compared with the same areas of opaque walls. The use of autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) walls reduces the total life cycle CO 2 emissions by almost 5.2% when compared with ordinary walls, while the use of thermal insulation with concrete wall reduces CO 2 emissions by 1.2%. The outcome of this work offers to the building industry a reliable indicator of the environmental impact of residential facade parameters. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",CO   emissions 2 | Facade parameters | Life cycle assessment,43,0,,,,undefined,

Volume II - Coefficients, 1998, Victoria University of Wellington, and the energy contained in the panel assembly process, transport and construction of the houses was determined by a data collection company specializing in the construction of houses built in SIP. For the operational energy, computational models were carried out with Design Builder software, with information of the house from thermography and infiltration essays, and this energy was projected at 50 years lifespan. The analysis of the data obtained show that the energy contained by construction processes represents about 1.7% of embodied energy, while the total energy embodied represents 11% of the total life cycle energy of houses, the remaining 89% represents the energy of occupation. On the other hand, we observe that SIP houses generate figures close to 60% savings in energy demand, compared to a common masonry houses with no method of thermal insulation, which were commonly built in this city.",Construction materials | Embodied energy | Environmental assessment | Operational building energy,0,0,,,,undefined,

To date the focus has been on reducing the operational element, although given the urgency of carbon reductions, it may be more beneficial to consider upfront embodied carbon reductions. This paper describes a case study on the whole life carbon cycle of a warehouse building in Swindon, UK. It examines the relationship between embodied carbon (Ec) and operational carbon (Oc), the proportions of Ec from the structural and non-structural elements, carbon benchmarking of the structure, the value of 'cradle to site' or 'cradle to grave' assessments and the significance of the timing of emissions during the life of the building. The case study indicates that Ec was dominant for the building and that the structure was responsible for more than half of the Ec. Weighting of future emissions appears to be an important factor to consider. The PAS 2050 reduction factors had only a modest ef ect but weighting to allow for future decarbonisation of the national grid energy supply had a large ef ect.

As a matter of fact, the production phase of building materials and components can significantly contribute to the total energy consumption and environmental loads of buildings. However, façade systems such as passive solar systems, ventilated walls and double skins, are usually not designed considering aspects related to their life cycle. Furthermore, there are still few studies concerning the optimization and the combined effect of different design features of complex façades on environmental and energy performances.This paper introduces an integrated approach for the optimization of energy and environmental performances of complex building envelopes that combines life cycle assessment, energy simulation and optimization analysis with factorial plan technique. The environmental performance was calculated in terms of energy demand and CO 2 emissions in the production phase and operational phase. The methodology was applied to an exemplary case study with solar wall systems.The results showed that solar walls have high environmental impact both in the production and operational phases. Results of the optimization analysis demonstrated that it is possible to reduce the CO 2 emissions and cumulative energy demand of solar walls for both the production and use phases up to -55% in comparison with a traditional design.

The combination of geoinformation systems and life cycle assessments (LCA) databases is a way to realise such complex calculations. By the example of energetic utilisation of biomass via conditioned biogas a geoinformation systems-based calculation tool is presented which combines geodata on biomass potentials, infrastructure, land use, cost and technology databases with analysis tools for the planning of biogas plants to identify the most efficient plant locations, to calculate balances of emissions, biomass streams and costs. Methods The calculations include the impact categories greenhouse gases, acidification, and eutrophication and were tested for the Lower Rhine region and the Altmark region in Germany. The results of the greenhouse gas (GHG) balances are presented. By using only nationwide available datasets, the calculation tool can be used in other regions as well. Results and discussion Balances of individual sites, regional balances and their temporal development can be calculated in geoinformation systems (GIS) using LCA methods. The composition of the substrates varies according to site and catchment area and lead to large variations in plant configurations and the resulting GHG balances and cost structures. Conclusions GIS tools do not only allow the assessment of individual plants, but also the determination of the GHG reduction potential, the biogas potential as well as the necessary investment costs for entire regions. Thus, the exploitation of regional biogas potentials in a way that is sustainable and climate-friendly becomes simple. © Springer-Verlag 2012.",Biogas | Biomass | Calculation tool | Geoinformation system | GHG emissions | Spatial analysis,23,0,,,,undefined,

Structural systems themselves are typically given little or no consideration for environmental effects; yet, in fact, they contribute significantly to the effects of climate change. Structural systems contribute to carbon emissions not only when they are built, but also over their service life, especially if they are located in regions of high seismic risk. The carbon footprint associated with the damage, repair, and partial reconstruction-or in some cases the full demolition and reconstruction-have considerable effects on the environment. The carbon footprint of a building is sensitive to its structural system with results that may be significantly more favorable with enhanced seismic resistance systems such as baseisolation or viscous dampers. Integrating environmental performance with seismic risk provides opportunities to communicate the benefits of enhanced seismic performance with regards to damage mitigation and environmental impacts to owners, developers, and the general public. Since currently available carbon assessment tools do not fully address the long-term environmental impact of structures, especially as it relates to probabilistic seismic damage, the Environmental Analysis Tool™ has been developed and is capable of considering the environmental impact of structural systems over the entire life cycle of the building. The program is capable of predicting carbon emission equivalents at the conception of design simply by knowing the location of the proposed building, the size of the project, the structural material type, and the expected service life. The program is also capable of performing analysis during the later stages of design, for specific project information. The program can be used to evaluate new and existing structures. Several example projects are overviewed and the impact of probabilistic seismic damage on the carbon footprint is evaluated. Furthermore, a cost-benefit analysis considering enhanced seismic systems conducted. The Environmental Analysis Tool™ is also implemented in a parametric environment for the assessment of buildings at an urban-scale. With the generated carbon footprint results, designers and planners can consider carbon emission equivalents of proposed buildings in the earliest phases of design. © ASCE 2012.",,9,0,,,,undefined,

Recently, along with the consistent interest in environmental problems, environmental impact has also become a key factor. Accordingly, there is a need to develop a method that simultaneously reflects the cost and environmental impact in the decision-making process. This study proposed an integrated model for assessing the cost and CO 2 emission (IMACC) at the same time. IMACC is a model that assesses the cost and CO 2 emission of the various structural-design alternatives proposed in the structural-design process. To develop the IMACC, a standard on assessing the cost and CO 2 emission generated in the construction stage was proposed, along with the CO 2 emission factors in the structural materials, based on such materials' strengths. Moreover, using the economic and environmental scores that signify the cost and CO 2 emission reduction ratios, respectively, a method of selecting the best design alternative was proposed. To verify the applicability of IMACC, practical application was carried out. Structural designs were assessed, each of which used 21, 24, 27, and 30 MPa ready-mix concrete (RMC). The use of IMACC makes it easy to verify what the best design is. Results show the one that used 27 MPa RMC was the best design. Therefore, the proposed IMACC can be used as a tool for supporting the decision-making process in selecting the best design alternative. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",CO   emission 2 | Economic score | Environmental score | Life cycle assessment | Life cycle cost,60,0,,,NRF,2010-0027246,National Research Foundation of Korea

The basic tool focuses on the structure and the materials of the buildings and permits the evaluation of the Embodied energy, Embodied carbon and yearly energy consumption. For that purpose, a different set of original data is taken into account for each location, in which the monthly temperatures, energy mix, heating and cooling systems are defined. The energy consumption, being for heating space or water, for cooling or for lighting is transformed into CO 2 emissions to deduce the Operational carbon as well. The influence of the energy mix can therefore be assessed in the basic tool. As a matter of fact, the heating and cooling systems habitually used in the three countries are also of great importance. The District Heating system, is, for instance, incorporated in the basic tool. The presence of solar water heater or photovoltaic panels is also strongly influencing the operational carbon. After a short literature review on building LCA and the description of the basic tool, the software Pleiades + Comfie combined with Equer is used to achieve the complete LCA for one building using two different load bearing frames.

In a recent study, a modular building was studied in Coimbra and Luleå. It was shown that in terms of CO 2 emissions, the Use Stage was the most harmful stage during the building life-cycle for Coimbra climate. Contrarily, in Luleå, it was the Product Stage, despite energy consumption being higher than Coimbra, due to the way electricity and heat are generated. In the present study, two structural systems are first compared for the Belgian house: steel frame and traditional masonry. A different life-cycle scenario is taken into account for the steel frame house for the three different locations, in which the monthly temperatures, energy mix, heating and cooling systems are defined. The LCA is carried out using the basic tool described in the companion paper. It is worth recalling that the results obtained with the basic tool were verified against Pleiades + Comfie and Equer software, enabling to carry out a complete LCA, for Brussels. Our results confirm that for all the three climates, the Use Stage (Operational energy) is the most harmful period during the building life-cycle and that the energy mix of the country strongly influences the equivalent CO 2 emissions related to the Use Stage (Operational carbon) and may entirely reverse the conclusions about the life-cycle carbon footprint of the building. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Embodied energy/carbon | Energy mix | Life-cycle analysis | Steel frame house,81,0,,,,undefined,

The distribution profile was constructed with the material use data collected from thirteen high-rise office concrete buildings in Hong Kong. Our results indicate that the superstructure of an office building (i.e. it does not embrace foundation or basement), on average, had a footprint of 215.1 kg CO 2/m 2. External walls and upper floor construction had the highest CO 2 footprint, followed by suspended ceilings and finishes. These three elements altogether accounted for an average of 84.2% of the CO 2 footprint associated with the superstructure. Furthermore, this study also evaluated the emissions reduction impacts of five different material use options over a 60-year lifespan. Among all the studied options, the most effective option is to maintain 15-30% of the existing structural and non-structural building elements as it can reduce the CO 2 footprint by 17.3%. Diverting construction wastes to recycling can reduce the CO 2 footprint by 5.9%. Reusing resources and importing regional materials can each only reduce the CO 2 footprint by 3.2% and 3.1% respectively. In contrast, the CO 2 footprint will be increased by 5% if off-site fabricated materials are used in facades, slabs and partition walls. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, the optimal design of residential buildings should consider multiple, and usually competitive, objectives such as energy consumption optimization, financial costs reduction and decrease of environmental impacts. This makes it a challenging multi-objective optimization problem. The aim of this work is to develop a novel method to tackle the problem. A multi-objective optimization model based on harmony search algorithm (HS) is presented. This model is developed to minimize the life cycle cost (LCC) and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) emissions of the buildings. Several building envelope parameters are taken as the design variables. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach the performance of the model is tested on a typical single-family house.

In addition to using energy while constructing a building, several systems also use power while the building is operating, especially the air-conditioning system. Energy consumption for this system is related, among other issues, to external air temperature and the required internal temperature of the building. The façades are elements which present the highest level of ambient heat transfer from the outside to the inside of tall buildings. Thus, the type of façade has an influence on energy consumption during the building life cycle and, consequently, contributes to buildings' CO 2 emissions, because these emissions are directly connected to energy consumption. Therefore, the aim is to help develop a methodology for evaluating CO 2 emissions generated during the life cycle of office building façades. The results, based on the parameters used in this study, show that façades using structural glazing and uncolored glass emit the most CO 2 throughout their life cycle, followed by brick façades covered with compound aluminum panels or ACM (Aluminum Composite Material), façades using structural glazing and reflective glass and brick façades with plaster coating. On the other hand, the typology of façade that emits less CO 2 is brickwork and mortar because its thermal barrier is better than structural glazing façade and materials used to produce this façade are better than brickwork and ACM. Finally, an uncertainty analysis was conducted to verify the accuracy of the results attained. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Building façade | CO   emissions 2 | Life cycle assessment,43,0,,,FAPESP,undefined,Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo

The reformist approach is predominant and seeks to keep responses to crises within the bounds of established economic and social relations, with fundamental systems rules not challenged. Radical alternatives see transformation in the structure of governance regimes and forms of agency as necessary components in moving towards a more resilient and sustainable future. The richer world’s responses to climate change and the financial crisis of 2008 have been dominated by reformist discourses in which the hegemony of the current capitalist mode of production provides the core narrative to resilience, and shapes the basis upon which crisis and vulnerability is understood, interpreted and acted upon. Under the reformist worldview the main changes required are technological and administrative, and therefore appear as a matter of efficiency, bureaucratic reorganization and policy-making. This has led policy attention to look towards the accelerated adoption of green technologies and innovation in insurance and engineering solutions to meet the challenge of environmental change, while coping with economic fluctuation or business cycles through either reducing public social spending (to bail out banks) or perhaps, following the insights of Keynesian analysis, expanding public investment in times of market contraction. In fact the combined financial and environmental crisis was consistently presented by mainstream media and governments as a win-win opportunity to stimulate the economy through investment which would simultaneously transform the energy grid with renewables. This win-win strategy required sustained stimulus packages, which in retrospect only some countries, notably the USA and China, were willing or in a position to provide. In most of Europe, where public spending has been severely cut, the financial crisis has restricted investment in and adoption of renewables, and shifted the attention of politicians and the media away from environmental priorities. At the time of writing, the latest turn in energy policy demonstrates well the unpredictability of policy pathways. The devastating East Japan earthquake, tsunami and associated radiation leak from the Fukushima reactor in 2011 have had global repercussions, and in Europe this is exemplified by Germany’s withdrawal from new nuclear investment and increased support for renewables: not an insignificant act for the World’s fifth largest economy (World Bank, 2011). Elsewhere, China in particular demonstrates the complexity of energy economics, being both an impressive global-scale investor in renewables and a major net global carbon polluter. Projects such as the Three Gorges dam, which was rejected for funding by the World Bank, and has displaced over one million people, arguably signifies both the scale of China’s ambition to respond to the climate change challenge and establish domestic energy security, and the catastrophic impacts such driven responses can have for local populations and ecologies. Emerging trends in the marketization of national food and resource security policy through the buying of long-term land and resource rights hints at new ways in which the balance of security between richer and poorer countries will unfold. In 2011, for example, Bangladesh began a process of acquiring the leases for large areas of African land as part of this flood-prone country’s national strategy for food security. Over 600, 000 hectares are reported being under discussion (Reuters, 2011). This is an adaptive response with implications for both countries, and builds on a practice of national resource security through control of production spearheaded by Africa, Latin America and elsewhere by China. Given the dynamism of global economic and associated political relations outlined above, it is perhaps understandable for politicians and citizens alike to search for a degree of stability and to equate this with security. The view that both economic fluctuations and environmental degradation can be kept under reasonably sustainable, or at least manageable limits without radically changing the prevalent institutional order has consequently become popular and captured the articulation of policy under the name of resilience (Brown, Chapter 3, this volume). But is institutional reform sufficient? If not, under which conditions is a radical approach more likely to take place? Returning to Chapter1, Handmer and Dovers (1996) warn us that established political and socio-economic systems are hard to shift; path-dependency embodied in institutions as well as physical infrastructure and assumptions about the way life should be are considerable challenges to be faced by any agenda that seeks more than a ‘tinkering at the margins’. Yet, the scale of threat associated with the combined economic and ecological expressions of crisis point to such deep-rooted concerns with the dominant mode of capitalism. Accordingly, we argue that the task of social science is now more than ever to look beyond the prevalent rules and imagine what an alternative, low-carbon, high-equity and low-risk future might look like - and how we might get there. We need critical theories of transformational social change that go beyond hopes for a technological solution and liberal democracy policy. A grand transformation is required on a par with humanity’s movement from hunter-gather to sedentary agriculture, the enlightenment or the industrial revolution. Taking on the scale of the challenge, and following Marx’s insights on the transition from feudalism to capitalism, David Harvey (2009) advances a ‘co-revolutionary theory’. This proposal was noted in Chapter 1 and we turn to it again here as a starting point for a radical transformational view. Harvey’s co-revolutionary theory proposes studying the dialectical unfolding of relations between seven moments of social change: (1) technological and organizational forms of production, exchange, and consumption; (2) relations to nature; (3) social relations between people; (4) mental conceptions of the world, embracing knowledges and cultural understandings and beliefs; (5) labour processes and production of specific goods, geographies, services, or affects; (6) institutional, legal and governmental arrangements, and (7) the conduct of daily life that underpins social reproduction. Each one of these moments is internally dynamic and internally marked by tensions and contradictions, but all of them are codependent and co-evolve in relation to each other. In the case of political ecology, Harvey’s approach can be linked to the Common Pool Resource theories and the Diagnostic Approach proposed by political scientist (and Nobel Laureate in Economics) Elinor Ostrom (2007, 2008) that explained the emergence of capitalist production from communal forms of resource exploitation. Ostrom drew on game theory while Harvey writes a grand theory in political economy. Social sciences can contribute with theories and straightforward methodologies to understand social change praxis, including its informal, personal and human dimensions. In particular, we argue that research should pay further attention to the role of human agency and the processes of alienation from ourselves, society and nature. Complexity theory shows that ‘agents’ in chemical, biological and management systems self-organize by following simple interaction rules from which complex patterns emerge (as outlined in Chapter 1). Human agents are heterogeneous (not like the Homo Oeconomicus) and enjoy much higher degrees of freedom to choose, and create, rules of interaction than the agents from biophysical systems. However, these crucial moments of choice in which emancipated or alienated individuals and collectivities seize, or not, opportunities for change seem crucial for the study of grand social transitions. This chapter synthesizes key points made throughout the book and organizes these against existing proposals for reform and more radical responses that begin to point to how people in rich and poorer societies might approach the grand transformation that must lie not too far ahead.",,0,0,,,,undefined,

Therefore, the minimization of energy requirements of buildings, as well as the reduction of emissions produced within the buildings life cycle has become a point of interest of many engineers, designers, architects or researchers. Every process in construction sector requires large amounts of energy, which mostly originate from fossil fuels, emits substantial amounts of CO2 or SO2 and produces waste or pollution. Existence of buildings is thus responsible for more than one third of green house gasses produced, as well as for consumption of about the same share of energy. The selection of building materials used for construction of building is usually performed on the basis of technical and economical parameters. However, a question of environmental performance is increasingly taken into consideration with the principal aim of reaching sustainability, but is still not sufficient. As a matter of wide range of various parameters with different importance it is sometimes difficult to select the best-suited construction. In this paper a selection of building materials to construct external walls with technical, as well as environmental criteria in mind using multi criteria selection is presented. 5 compositions of external walls made of aerated concrete blocks with thickness of 300 mm and 375 mm were included into evaluation. In 4 structures the thermal insulation material (2 types of mineral insulation or 2 types of polystyrene) was added. Multi criteria analysis was performed on the basis of assessors' preference as well as on the basis of their considerable importance. Evaluation included technical parameters, such as thickness of wall, weight of used material, quantity of layers; thermal-physical parameters (calculated U-value, surface temperature) and environmental parameters, which were calculated on the basis of available materials' database. Environmental assessment was focused on 3 parameters: embodied energy of materials expressed by amount of Primary Energy Intensity, amount of CO2 emissions as Global Warming Potential and quantity of acidification gasses as Acidification Potential. Calculated values of environmental indicators were in range from 554.56 MJ/m2 to 689.25 MJ/m2 in the case of Primary Energy Intensity. Amount of calculated CO2 emissions (Global Warming Potential) ranged from 49.26 kg CO 2eq/m2 to 58.88 kg CO2eq/m2 and values of Acidification Potential were calculated in range from 0.1296 kg SO2eq/m2 to 0.2063 kg SO2eq/m2. Environmental performance was compared with conventional evaluation and the optimal construction from the evaluated external walls was chosen.

The present work aims at evaluating the environmental impact, and therefore the actual sustainability of this technology, examining a ground-mounted 1778.48kWp photovoltaic plant, realized by TerniEnergia S.p.A. and located in Marsciano (Perugia, Italy). The analysis is conducted using the methodology of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which allows to consider all stages of the life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials to the plant's disposal ("" from a cradle to grave perspective""). In particular, the study takes into account the soil preparation, the installation of fence and electrical substations of low and medium voltage, the mounting of support structures, also with reference to hot dip galvanizing process, the production of modules, their installation, the wiring apparatus and the network connection. The transport of all components to the installation site is considered for each stage that is examined. The end of life scenario of the plant is also evaluated. The possibility to collect many detailed information in the construction site, during the building phase, adds value to the study. The analysis is carried out according to UNI EN ISO 14040 and UNI EN ISO 14044, which regulate the LCA procedure. The LCA modelling was performed using SimaPro software application and using Eco Indicator 99 methodology. The results of the analysis allows to calculate some important parameters like EPBT (Energy Pay-Back Time), EROEI (Energy Return on Energy Invested), CO2 emissions and GWP100 (Global Warming Potential).

Eight scenarios were defined in terms of diffuse (D) and compact (C) urban models and the tank locations ((1) underground tank, (2) below-roof tank, (3) distributed-over-roof tank, and (4) block tank). The structural and hydraulic sizing of the catchment, storage, and distribution subsystems was taken into account using an average Mediterranean rainfall, the area of the harvesting surfaces, and a constant water demand for laundry. The quantification of environmental impacts was performed through a life cycle assessment, using CML 2001 Baseline method. The necessary materials and processes were considered in each scenario according to the lifecycle stages (i.e., materials, construction, transportation, use, and deconstruction) and subsystems. Results and discussion: The environmental characterization indicated that the best scenario in both urban models is the distributed-over-roof tank (D3, C3), which provided a reduction in impacts compared to the worst scenario of up to 73% in diffuse models and even higher in compact ones, 92% in the most dramatic case. The lower impacts are related to the better distribution of tank weight on the building, reducing the reinforcement requirements, and enabling energy savings. The storage subsystem and the materials stage contributed most significantly to the impacts in both urban models. In the compact density model, the underground-tank scenario (C1) presented the largest impacts in most categories due to its higher energy consumption. Additionally, more favorable environmental results were observed in compact densities than in diffuse ones for the Global Warming Potential category along with higher water efficiencies. Conclusions: The implementation of one particular RWH scenario over another is not irrelevant in drought-stress environments. Selecting the most favorable scenario in the development of newly constructed residential areas provides significant savings in CO2 emissions in comparison with retrofit strategies. Therefore, urban planning should consider the design of RWH infrastructures using environmental criteria in addition to economic, social, and technological factors, adjusting the design to the potential uses for which the rainwater is intended. Recommendations and perspectives: Additional research is needed to quantify the energy savings associated with the insulation caused by using the tank distributed over the roof. The integration of the economic and social aspects of these infrastructures in the analysis, from a life cycle approach, is necessary for targeting the planning and design of more sustainable cities in an integrated way. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Carbon emissions | Environmental impact | Laundry demand | LCA | Reinforcement | Sustainable cities | Urban planning | Water management,99,0,,,MECD,BIA2010-20789-C04-01,"Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte"

The study also investigated different intervention strategies and recommends strategies that facilitate the highest reduction in life cycle primary energy consumption. The research found that overall, lower life cycle primary energy consumption does not necessarily lead to lower carbon emissions as carbon reduction depend on a combination of primary energy consumption, magnitude of heating and cooling, fuel mix profile and efficiency of the conventional grid. While the common perception is that old buildings often perform badly in terms of energy conservation, the relatively higher rating for some buildings found in this study shows that this is not always the case. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Energy efficiency | Heritage residential buildings | Integrated life cycle assessment (LCA) framework | Intervention strategies,81,0,,,DSE,undefined,Department of Sustainability and Environment

However, these coatings may not be as effective in certain climate zones and create glare problems for adjacent buildings. A transparent composite façade system (TCFS) was newly configured to provide a sustainable alternative to a high performance glass wall in that the biofiber composite core acts as a shading device while the airspace between the polymer skins provides adequate insulation. A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) method was selected as a sustainability measuring tool to compare the environmental impacts of a TCFS with a glass curtain wall system (GCWS). In this paper, the environmental performance of a façade system is characterized by the energy consumption and CO2 emissions through all stages of the life cycle. Comparative LCA results show that the total life cycle energy of the TCFS is estimated to be 93% of that of the uncoated GCWS, and the total emissions of kg CO2 equivalent for the TCFS is determined to be 89% of the uncoated GCWS. The use phase for both the TCFS and GCWS plays a dominant role in reducing environmental impacts while the impact associated with transportation and the end-of-life management is estimated to be insignificant in this study.

Structures located in regions of high seismic risk are particularly important since they are likely to experience seismic damage during their service life. The life-cycle performance and the carbon footprint of these structures are sensitive to their structural system with outcomes that are significantly more favorable when enhanced systems are used. Historically, the effects of buildings on the changing environment were evaluated based on mechanical, electrical, and plumbing building system energy use related to daily operations. Structures themselves are typically given little or no consideration for environmental effects; yet, in fact, they contribute significantly to the effects of climate change. Structures contribute to carbon emissions not only when they are built, but also over their service life, especially if they are located in regions of high seismic risk. The carbon footprint associated with the damage, repair, and partial reconstruction-or in some cases the full demolition and reconstruction-have considerable effects on the environment. Structures must not only be evaluated based on their initial cost, constructability, and material availability; they also must be evaluated based on their long-term environmental effects. A carbon footprint analysis tool that considers a comprehensive evaluation of structural systems-both prescriptive and enhanced-is presented. The analysis tool is intended to rapidly and accurately quantify the airpolluting emissions associated with the structure. Using a combination of publicly available and privately developed information, the analysis tool assesses all emissions associated with all components of a building's structural system, employing a complete life cycle assessment of the structural components, incorporating probable seismic loss and repair costs that are based on the local site seismicity and the fragility of the structural system.

Using scientific methods for consumption-related carbon emissions accounting is the basis and prerequisite for low-carbon consumption research to account the consumption-related carbon emissions with a scientific methods. Life cycle assessment (LCA), which can calculate the total environmental impact of the whole production process with a new system perspective, is considered as a suitable method on environmental impact evaluation of household consumption. But the traditional process-oriented LCA requires a clear definition of system boundary, and focuses on the environmental impact within the system boundary. However, many LCA case studies showed that the environmental impact occurred outside the system boundaries can not be always ignored. Subsequently the EIO-LCA approach is proposed (Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment), which is a combination of input-output analysis and LCA concept. The new EIO-LCA method overcame the natural defects of the traditional LCA. This paper studied carbon dioxide emissions which were embodied in Chinese household consumption in the years of 1997, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2007, and found out that it increased quickly over time. The result shows that the carbon emissions in 2007 reached 1. 85 billion tons, equivalent to 1. 61 times in 1997. This upward trend in emissions is driven by a variety of factors. It is assumed that there were six factors, including carbon emission intensity, internal structure of the economy, consumption structure, consumption level per capita, urbanization and population in this study. Then the impact strength of these six factors is evaluated with the Structural Decomposition Analysis (SDA) method. SDA is a special index decomposition analysis with an input-output method. SDA is often used to analyze the contribution of economic growth, economic structural change and technological progress and other factors to changes in economic or environmental indicators. The result indicated that the factors of emission intensity and consumption level per capita were two main contrary forces. The emission intensity was the main force that slowed down the increase of carbon emissions, while the consumption level per capita was the main force to radically promote the increase of carbon emissions. Changes in consumption structure, urbanization and population growth have continued to promote the increasing of carbon emissions. Leontief inverse matrix, representing the internal structure of the national economy, has a more complex role, and shows different roles at different times. These six factors played different roles in each sector. Industry of production and supply of electric power, steam and hot water, chemical industry, non-metallic mineral products industry, metal smelting and rolling processing industry and food manufacturing and tobacco processing were the five major departments that these factors relatively had strong impact on. In the next few decades, energy efficiency improvement, energy structure optimization will be the primary means to achieve low-carbon economy. At the same time, industrial restructuring should be speed up and the consumption structure should be optimized to provide an efficient way for construction of China's low-carbon economy.

This paper compares the embodied carbon in a low energy, affordable house constructed using a novel offsite panellised modular timber frame system, in Norfolk UK with two traditional alternative scenarios. A lifecycle assessment (LCA) framework is used to conduct a partial LCA, from cradle to site, of the construction. An inventory of the materials and fossil fuel energy utilised in the construction was used to calculate the primary energy consumed and the associated embodied carbon. The embodied carbon was found to be 34.6 tonnes CO2 for a 3 bedroom semi-detached house, 405 kgCO2 per m2 of useable floor area. When compared with traditional methods of construction the modern methods of construction (MMC) house resulted in a 34% reduction in embodied carbon. Despite timber being the predominant structural and cladding material, concrete is the most significant material (by proportion) in embodied carbon terms, responsible for 36% of materials related embodied carbon. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In the near future, embodied energy could account for a significant proportion of a building's carbon footprint over its lifetime, bearing in mind that the construction of energy-efficient buildings is carbon and energy intensive. Unlike operational energy, embodied energy savings have an immediate significant effect on carbon footprint and are independent of human behaviour. However, there is a lack of consensus within the construction industry on how to assess embodied energy and carbon dioxide and where to draw system boundaries, which has impeded advancement on the issue. This paper analyses the life-cycle embodied energy and carbon dioxide emissions of a building's structural elements, and examines which stages within a building's life are the most significant and offer the most opportunities for a reduction of embodied energy and carbon dioxide. The embodied energy and associated carbon dioxide at the product and construction, maintenance and end-of-life stages of a structure are examined, as well as the potential for energy recovery and carbon dioxide offsetting.

The aim of this paper is to develop and apply several criteria for the building sector that help decision making at the design and construction stages, thereby allowing the selection of sustainable building materials, reducing the environmental impact of the materials used, minimizing the amount of waste generated, and increasing the percentage of this waste that is recycled. From a life cycle perspective during the construction phase, results showed that regarding to environmental impact of global warming potential, there was a total emission of 1.19E+01 kg CO2 equiv. m-2 y-1 (referred to m2 of horizontal constructed area) of which about 85% was during the fabrication, while the rest was due to the energy consumed (8%), transport (6%) and waste management (1%). When analysing the whole building, the total waste obtained in the construction phase was 4.56E+01 kg m-2 of which rest of materials account for 84% (internal and external walls 30%, architectural finishing 23% and foundations and basement 19%) and packaging waste represents 16% (roofing 31%, structural frame 22%, architectural finishing 15% and internal and external walls 10% of the total waste). Finally, in this paper we compare the different combinations of real construction scenarios for external and internal walls while taking into account the environmental and economic aspects and also three different systems of waste management: landfill, incineration and recycling have been evaluated. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

An economic incentive was awarded to cover the extra costs of the thermal insulation, windows and equipment in order to decrease the yearly winter heat requirement from the legal standard of 109 to 10 kWh/m2, while existing buildings in the study area typically require 200 kWh/m2. As the building was claimed to be sustainable on the basis of its outstanding energy-saving performance, an ex post life cycle assessment (LCA) was set up to understand whether, and to what extent, the positive judgement could be confirmed in a life cycle perspective. Materials and methods After an analysis of the literature on LCA of whole buildings, a detailed life cycle assessment has been conducted by encompassing all the life cycle phases. Emphasis was given on the end-of-life stage, too often disregarded due to lack of data or heavily simplified. Virtually all the materials used in the building structure, finishes and equipment were considered, paying attention to their expected service duration and the recycling potential. In order to increase transparency and therefore credibility and acceptance of LCA in the building sector, an uncertainty analysis was carried out. Results and discussion The dramatic contribution of material-related impacts emerged. Structure and finishes materials represented the highest relative contribution, but maintenance operations also played a major role. The contributions of equipment, construction stage and transportation were minor. The important role of the recycling potential also emerged. Unlike standard buildings, where heating-related impacts overshadow the rest of the life cycle, there is no single dominating item or aspect. Rather, several of them play equally important roles. Conclusions The study confirmed that the initial goal of resource and environmental efficiency was reached, but to a much lower extent than previously thought. In comparison to a standard house, while the winter heat requirement was reduced from109 to 10kWh/m2 (10:1 ratio), the life cycle energy was only reduced by 2.1:1 and the carbon footprint by 2.2:1. Recommendations and perspectives The findings emphasise the need for incorporating the life cycle approach in energy-saving policies and economic incentives schemes in the building sector, in Italy and elsewhere, as single-step improvements might not be effective in a life cycle perspective and could even disappoint expectations. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",End of life | Energy policies | LCA of whole buildings | Low-energy buildings | Recycling potential | Uncertainty analysis,104,0,,,,undefined,

The goals of this paper are to estimate life-cycle energy savings, carbon emission reduction, and cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency measures in new commercial buildings using an integrated design approach, and estimate the implications from a cost on energy-based carbon emissions. A total of 576 energy simulations are run for 12 prototypical buildings in 16 cities, with 3 building designs for each building-location combination. Simulated energy consumption and building cost databases are used to determine the life-cycle cost-effectiveness and carbon emissions of each design. The results show conventional energy efficiency technologies can be used to decrease energy use in new commercial buildings by 20-30% on average and up to over 40% for some building types and locations. These reductions can often be done at negative life-cycle costs because the improved efficiencies allow the installation of smaller, cheaper HVAC equipment. These improvements not only save money and energy, but reduce a building's carbon footprint by 16% on average. A cost on carbon emissions from energy use increases the return on energy efficiency investments because energy is more expensive, making some cost-ineffective projects economically feasible.",Carbon cost | Energy efficiency | Integrated design | Life-cycle assessment | Life-cycle costing,322,0,,,,undefined,

Double skin façades offer exciting opportunities to reduce energy consumption and to passively manage comfort conditions while enabling large areas of glass with high levels of visual transparency. Achieving a balance between conflicting design parameters and client aspirations begins at the concept design stage. It requires a multi-disciplinary, multi-faceted engineering approach which encompasses structural glass design, building science, thermal and energy profile simulation, solar and daylight penetration analysis, structural design, sustainable assessment methods, and whole life cycle cost analysis.

Much of the housing was low-density with poor public transport links leading to doubts over its sustainability-particularly in terms of energy use. Although the country is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above 1990 levels by the period 2008-2012, by 2005, emissions were already 25.4% higher than the baseline and current projections are that this figure will rise to 37% over the period. The residential sector is estimated to contribute to approximately 24.5% of energy-related CO2 emissions. This paper estimates total emissions from residential developments in the GDA constructed between 1997 and 2006. Materials and methods: Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2) emissions are estimated using a life cycle assessment approach over a 100-year building lifespan and employing process, input-output and hybrid energy techniques. Life cycle stages include: construction, operation, transport, maintenance and demolition. The main data sources include: national population and industry census data, household travel survey data, residential energy performance surveys and national accounts. The GDA was split into four zones each encompassing development at increasing radii from Dublin's city centre, namely: city centre, suburbs, exurbs and commuter towns. Results: Per capita CO 2 life cycle emissions in the GDA were found to be approximately 50-55% greater in the exurbs and commuter towns than in the city centre. Of the five life cycle stages studied, operational energy requirements (predominantly space heating and hot water, but including power) contributed most significantly to emissions (68%), followed by transport (17%), construction (9%) and maintenance/renovation (6%). Discussion: Operating emissions from dwellings in the commuter town and extra-urban zones were almost twice those in the city centre both due to larger dwelling sizes and the predominance of detached and semi-detached dwellings (with large amounts of exposed walls) in the former and the prevalence of smaller apartments in the latter. Car use was most pronounced in the zones furthest from the city centre where per capita emissions were almost twice those of residents in the city centre. Despite their smaller size, the per capita construction CO2 emissions of apartments were approximately one third greater than for low-rise dwellings due to the greater energy intensity of the structure. However, this difference was more than compensated for by the significantly lower operational emissions referred to above. Conclusions: In 2006, recurrent CO2 emissions (operational, transport and maintenance) from dwellings built in the GDA over the ten preceding years were 2,108 kt while construction-related emissions in that year were 1,325 kt giving a total contribution from the residential sector of 3,434 kt CO2/annum-representing 4.9% of national emissions for that year. Had the development policy prescribed 'city centre'-type development and transport modes, then emissions for the year 2006 would have been 2,892 kt CO2-a reduction of almost 16% over the actual figure. However, in this scenario recurrent emissions would have been reduced to 1,417 kt CO 2-a reduction of 33% over actual levels. Recommendations and perspectives: This study supports Irish and international governments' policies aimed at curbing CO2 emissions from the domestic sector which focus primarily on reducing operational emissions from new and existing housing through design and construction improvements. However, it demonstrates that significant reductions in operational emissions are associated with high-density residential development with modest floor areas. Furthermore, it highlights the scope for transport emissions' reductions through better spatial planning leading to reduced car travel. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Carbon dioxide equivalent | CO 2 | Domestic dwellings | Embodied energy | Energy | Greenhouse gas emissions | Life cycle assessment | Spatial planning,18,0,repositoryam,Green,DIT,undefined,Dublin Institute of Technology

Energy conversion facilities are represented in an agent-based model (ABM) as distinct instances of technologies with owners capable of making decisions based on economic and environmental information. This simulation setup allows us to explore the dynamics of assembly, disassembly, and use of these systems, which typically span decades, and to analyze the effect of using LCA information in decision making. We were able to integrate a simplified LCA into an ABM by aligning and connecting the data structures that represent the energy infrastructure and the supply chains from source to sink. By using an appropriate database containing life cycle inventory (LCI) information and by solving the scaling factors for the technology matrix, we computed the contribution to global warming in terms of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents in the form of a single impact indicator for each instance of technology at each discrete simulation step. These LCAs may then serve to show each agent the impact of its activities at a global level, as indicated by its contribution to climate change. Similar to economic indicators, the LCA indicators may be fed back to the simulated decision making in the ABM to emulate the use of environmental information while the system evolves. A proof of concept was developed that is illustrated for a simplified LCA and ABM used to generate and simulate the evolution of a bioelectricity infrastructure system. © 2009 by Yale University.",Bioenergy | Complexity | Industrial ecology | Matrix | Network | Ontology,75,0,repositoryam,Green,,undefined,

While carbon-emission reduction goals are plentiful in the building industry, there are relatively few reliable tools to actually quantify the carbon emissions produced by buildings. Carbon quantifying tools are obviously a necessity as validating design intent becomes more critical as more and more developers and architecture firms commit to low-carbon design policies. Our research team is developing a tool called GreenFoot to quantify the ecological footprint, including carbon emissions from any size or type of building. A unique aspect of this calculator is that it not only quantifies the carbon emissions produced by a building, but also relates this quantity to the capacity of the building site, using the ecological footprint methodology initially developed by Rees and Wakernagel. Eventually the tool will not only account for operational energy, but also account for the buildings embodied energy. Including a building's water and waste footprint are being developed as aspects of GreenFoot. By comparing building impacts to the ecological capacity of a site, GreenFoot creates a common language for architectural and ecological disciplines. The tool allows for the overall size of the impact and ecological efficiency to be measured through unique metrics initially described in a 2004 paper published in Solar Energy 77 entitled, ""The Application of Ecosystems Services Criteria for Green Building Assessment."" A common baseline of hectare/year allows projects of different sizes and typologies to be objectively compared. The time and area metrics of GreenFoot provides designers with the ability to plan the ecological debit and return of their buildings, similar to the life cycle analysis of a financial plan. GreenFoot can be used at the preliminary design phase (with estimated data) or at a final assessment stage with accurate data. The comparison feature allows your project to be measured against a reference project (base case) to show the degree of improvement. The calculation methods and results from Greenfoot have been verified against several carbon calculators, and have a high degree of accuracy. Future modifications may include providing options for aligning our emissions factors with those used by WRI calculators for the GHG Protocol. This tool will be demonstrated in its current state of development using case studies. The directions for further research and development of the tool will also be shown.",,7,0,,,,undefined,

The investigation considers a high speed ferry with a steel hull and an aluminium superstructure, an all aluminium concept and a ship built in sandwich material with carbon fibre faces. The different materials will affect several cost elements during the design, the production and the operation of the ship until and including its disposal. Furthermore, the material selection has an impact on the energy consumption within all stages of the ships life cycle. The assessment is made in a comparative manner. Hence, identical out fitting components, e.g. interior, instrumentation, and ventilation are left out. It is shown that the steel version causes the highest costs and energy consumption. The sandwich construction has the lowest life cycle costs while the aluminium version has the lowest energy consumption. The break-even point between the steel and the composite versions appears after 4 years (only 2 years of operation!), the break-even point between the aluminium and the composite ferry is after 12 years (10 years of operation). A sensitivity analysis with different possible scenarios, e.g. change in interest, fuel cost, maintenance cost, has been performed. All of the investigated scenarios identify the composite version to have the lowest life cycle costs.

Currently, only 40%, or 44.5 million metric tons, of coal combustion products (CCPs) generated in the United States each year by electric utilities are diverted from disposal in landfills or surface impoundments and recycled. Despite promising economic and environmental savings, there has been scant attention devoted to assessing life cycle impacts of CCP disposal and beneficial use. The objective of this paper is to present a life cycle inventory considering two cases of CCP management, including the stages of coal mining and preparation, coal combustion, CCP disposal, and CCP beneficial use. Six beneficial uses were considered: concrete production, structural fills, soil amendments, road construction, blasting grit and roofing granules, and wallboard. Methods. Primary data for raw material inputs and emissions of all stages considered were obtained from surveys and site visits of coal-burning utilities in Florida conducted in 2002, and secondary data were obtained from various published sources and from databases available in SimaPro 5.1 (PRé Consultants, Amersfoort, The Netherlands). Results. Results revealed that 50 percent of all CCPs produced, or 108 kg per 1,000 kg of coal combusted, are diverted for application in a beneficial use; however, the relative amounts sold by each utility is dependent on the process operating parameters, air emission control devices, and resulting quality of CCP. Diversion of 50% of all CCPs to beneficial use applications yields a decrease in the total raw materials requirements (with the exception of gravel and iron) and most emissions to air, water, and land, as compared to 100% disposal. Discussion. The greatest reduction of raw materials was attributed to replacing Portland cement with fly ash, using bottom ash as an aggregate in concrete production and road construction in place of natural materials, and substituting FGD gypsum for natural gypsum in wallboard. The use of fly ash as cementitious material in concrete also promised significant reductions in emissions, particularly the carbon dioxide that would be generated from Portland cement production. Beneficial uses of fly ash and gypsum showed reductions of emissions to water (particularly total dissolved solids) and emissions of metals to land, although these reductions were small compared to simply diverting 50% of all CCPs from landfills or surface impoundments. Conclusions. This life cycle inventory (LCI) provides the foundation for assessing the impacts of CCP disposal and beneficial use. Beneficial use of CCPs is shown here to yield reductions in raw material requirements and various emissions to all environmental compartments, with potential tangible savings to human health and the environment. Recommendations and Perspectives. Extension of this life cycle inventory to include impact assessment and sensitivity analysis will enable a determination of whether the savings in emissions reported here actually result in significant improvements in environmental and human health impacts. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Beneficial use | Coal combustion | Coal combustion products (CCPs) | Disposal | Emissions | Florida | Life Cycle Inventory (LCI),15,0,,,,undefined,

To evaluate the total net emissions change, one must consider changes in manufacture and associated life-cycle emissions, as well as changes in the quantity of material required. In addition, in principle one should also consider any differences in costs of the two designs because cost savings can be applied to other economic activities with associated environmental impacts. In this paper, a method is presented that combines these considerations to permit an evaluation of the net change in emissions when considering the adoption of emerging technologies/materials for civil infrastructure. The method factors in data on differences between a standard and new material for civil infrastructure, material requirements as specified in designs using both materials, and price information. The life-cycle assessment approach known as economic input-output life-cycle assessment (EIO-LCA) is utilized. A brief background on EIO-LCA is provided because its use is central to the method. The methodology is demonstrated with analysis of a switch from carbon steel to high-performance steel in military bridge design. The results are compared with a simplistic analysis that accounts for the weight reduction afforded by use of the high-performance steel but assuming no differences in manufacture.

Integrated product policy (IPP) addressing the life-cycle impacts of products forms an innovative new generation of environmental policy. Yet this policy requires insight into the final consumption expenditures and related products that have the greatest life-cycle environmental impacts. This review article brings together the conclusions of 11 studies that analyze the life-cycle impacts of total societal consumption and the relative importance of different final consumption categories. This review addresses in general studies that were included in the project Environmental Impacts of Products (EIPRO) of the European Union (EU), which form the basis of this special issue. Unlike most studies done in the past 25 years on similar topics, the studies reviewed here covered a broad set of environmental impacts beyond just energy use or carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The studies differed greatly in basic approach (extrapolating LCA data to impacts of consumption categories versus approaches based on environmentally extended input-output (EEIO) tables), geographical region, disaggregation of final demand, data inventory used, and method of impact assessment. Nevertheless, across all studies a limited number of priorities emerged. The three main priorities, housing, transport, and food, are responsible for 70% of the environmental impacts in most categories, although covering only 55% of the final expenditure in the 25 countries that currently make up the EU. At a more detailed level, priorities are car and most probably air travel within transport, meat and dairy within food, and building structures, heating, and (electrical) energy-using products within housing. Expenditures on clothing, communication, health care, and education are considerably less important. Given the very different approaches followed in each of the sources reviewed, this result hence must be regarded as extremely robust. Recommendations are given to harmonize and improve the methodological approaches of such analyses, for instance, with regard to modeling of imports, inclusion of capital goods, and making an explicit distinction between household and government expenditure. © 2006 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Yale University.",Consumption | Environmental assessment | Environmental policy | Input-output analysis (IOA) | Integrated product policy (IPP) | Life-cycle assessment (LCA),355,0,,,,undefined,

In this respect, the incorporation of resident, cost effective damage detection and monitoring systems is an important consideration, both to detect and track structural damage that may eventuate as well as to monitor the effectiveness of any subsequent repairs that may be carried out in an efficient and effective manner. The principal objective of this current research is to develop an advanced fibre optic monitoring system that will provide enhanced knowledge of the integrity of large strategic civil engineering structures, such as rail bridges, in order to assess their structural worthiness. Such integrated monitoring systems will also provide a means of evaluating the in-service performance of the structure for enhanced operational use in a safe and predictable condition. Existing methods for monitoring such structures are severely limited by the available technology, relying on electrical strain sensors and load cells that are time consuming to install and require a large number of electrical connections and thus complex cabling. These systems are also very difficult to embed during either the construction or any subsequent repair processes that may be carried out. Consequently, much monitoring is usually undertaken by periodic visual inspection or through the use of conventional strain gauges, which are not well suited either for long-term use or in harsh environments (e.g. during exposure to chlorides). Fibre Bragg grating sensor based monitoring systems on the other hand offer an enabling technology that can be used for online in-situ monitoring with unobtrusive, chemically inert and electrically immune sensing operation. To exploit this technology for monitoring applications in the remote, harsh environments of civil infrastructure, a multipoint and online monitoring capability with high data measurement repeatability is essential to allow for the continuous determination of the strain-dependent wavelength shift and to create a remotely accessible database providing a record of the condition of the structure over periodic test periods or during its operational lifetime. This can provide invaluable information on the structure in relation to the stress, shrinkage, creep, dead loading, post tensioning and structural degradation manifested by the appearance of cracks, fissures and corrosion. Further, such monitoring can permit the opportunity to record the static and dynamic loading history that is essential in for determining controlled maintenance procedures and schedules and for structural design assessment. This provides a powerful means to enhance the service quality, performance and thus improve the safety of the structure in a continuous fashion, both during construction and throughout its lifetime. This latter aspect is especially important when the structure is approaching its designed life-span or following unusual phenomena such as subsidence, earthquakes, accidental impacts, high winds, fire and flood in order to avoid catastrophic failure events. A portable and compact multiplexed FBG sensor demodulation unit utilising a 10 mw broadband light source centred at 1550 nm has been designed and developed specifically for long-term field application use. The laser diode is driven by a stabilised current source and feedback controlled thermo-electric controller to ensure good stability of its output power and spectral profile. Spatial multiplexing is achieved with an 8-way passive splitter for an 8-channel system utilising a scanning Fabry-Perot filter for wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) interrogation technique to de-multiplex the return signals from the array of gratings used as the strain sensitive devices. The instrumentation is capable of interrogating four sensors per channel for high level strain measurements (each capable of measuring >±2,500 με), although up to ten sensors can be configured along each fibre consequently reducing the maximum strain measured. The return signal from the serial gratings on each channel is detected via 8 parallel low noise (30 dB SNR) detectors. The detector circuits developed consist of two stage amplifiers with transimpedance and amplification/filtering stages of a bandwidth of 10 kHz. The detected Gaussian peak analogue signal is then sent to a plug-in data acquisition board (ADwin-light-16) with analogue inputs and outputs. The data acquisition board is designed around a SHARC DSP processor with its own local memory for fast data acquisition (conversion time of 10 μs), on-line processing (processing of each measurement can occur immediately after acquisition) and control of the scanning Fabry-Perot filter in real time under Windows. The board comes with proprietary real-time software (ADbasic) which allows programming mathematical operations and functions which are executed immediately after each sampling step. The Adwin DSP board also generates a ramp signal to drive the tuneable WDM filter as well as simultaneous data capture from the detection channels at every scan voltage. The DSP temporally resolves the optical spectra received from each of the 8 channels used for every scan of the Fabry-Perot cavity and thus the position of each peak is identified. In addition, post processing and data visualisation in the PC can be handled with many popular programming environments including Visual Basic and LabVIEW. To achieve linear drift free wavelength and thus strain and temperature readings, the measurements are made relative to the two thermally stabilised (to 0.15 pm) reference Bragg gratings which are assembled in a thermally controlled package for the rejection of common mode noise and multiplexing non-linearity, as well as wavelength scaling in a differential measurement. The reference gratings are also used to eliminate any long term or short-term thermal or shock vibration-induced drifts arising from the scanning filter. An accurate detection of the peak position in the wavelength domain is the key to accurate strain differentiation. Peak location involves least square curve fitting or threshold level detection around the peak from which the centroid of the reflected grating spectra is calculated. The system designed is capable of measuring multipoint data using for potential use in strain mapping across a large structure with a short term resolution of ±2 με and bandwidth of 100 Hz. Comparative measurements with resistive strain gauges showed close correlation highlighting the performance of the system. Long term test results also show that the strain resolution of the system at full bandwidth is less than ±5 με. In most monitoring applications, Bragg grating sensors are either surface bonded to existing structures or embedded within the structures during manufacture. Several bonding adhesives and techniques of attachment have been investigated to optimise the strain transfer and to achieve high repeatability and sensor integrity in long-term measurement use. Cynoacrylate type adhesives achieved near to 100% strain transfer in a manner that was consistent over many tests with no degradation of the sensors or the bonding mechanisms employed. Prior to attachment, the acrylate coating on the Bragg gratings was stripped off to enhance the bonding to the surface, which was cleaned by using an appropriate solvent. Furthermore, tensile test results on post embedded array of Bragg grating sensors into carbon fibre structures, in an attempt to create a smart sensing strips or strengthening rods, have shown good results correlating with surface attached electrical strain gauges. Fibre Bragg grating sensors can also be embedded into carbon composite structures of various thicknesses during the composite pultrusion stage. Such robust sensor packaging will result in preassembled sensors that could routinely be used in harsh environments, large concrete or masonry structures with ease. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group.",,3,0,,,,undefined,

This gate-to-gate study includes all materials, fuels, and electricity inputs to produce I-joists, co-products, and emissions. The inputs included the laminated veneer lumber (LVL) used for the I-joist's flanges and the oriented strandboard (OSB) used for the web, but it excluded the LCI for their input logs. Data were collected through surveys of manufacturing facilities in the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast. In addition to LCI data, transportation distances for delivery of materials are also provided. SimaPro software, a program to conduct life-cycle inventory and assessment studies, is used to process the data and determine environmental impacts in terms of material and energy use, and emissions. The impact data are allocated on a mass basis to I-joist based on their mass contribution to the sum of all product and co-product generated during the manufacturing process. All data are provided on a production unit basis of 1.0 km and 1.0 MLF (one thousand linear feet), the U.S. industry practice. In addition to LCI data, carbon flow data are also given. These LCI data are publicly available through comprehensive reports, this summary publication, and the U.S. Life-Cycle Inventory Database Project. The data are useful for generating cradle-to-gate product LCIs when combined with the LCIs to produce logs for the mills and material transportation impacts, and are useful as a benchmark for assessing process performance, and for conducting life-cycle analysis of floor and roof assemblies and residential structures using I-joists. © 2006 by the Society of Wood Science and Technology.",Building materials | Carbon balance | Emissions | Energy | I-joists | LCI | Life-cycle inventory,13,0,,,,undefined,

Increasing costs for transport, incineration and storage have to be considered. As the waste sector will face enormous challenges new recycling strategies from industry are required. On the other hand at the Kyoto Conference in 1997 Germany agreed to reduce the CO 2 emission by 21% to the level of 1998 by 2005 [1,2]. Cement and concrete have an important role to play in enabling Germany to fulfil its obligation to reduce the CO2 emissions. Nevertheless the potential of traditional reduction methods for concrete, such as very expensive new technologies for cement and concrete production, the substitution of cement by fly ash and the minimization of the cement content is limited. Because c oncrete is used in the majority of buildings in the structural elements, the use of waste is imminent and can lead to a substantial reduction of CO 2 emissions of concrete while reducing the mentioned costs of waste management. The paper will show the optimisation procedure for concrete mixtures using crushed concrete as aggregates and substituting cement with ash from the combustion of sewage sludge or by waste incinerator slag and low quality fly ash at the same time. The main mechanical properties of such ""green"" concretes are presented. Chemical analysis will give further information about the effects of such ""green concrete"" on the environment.",CO  emissions- Kyoto 2 | Compressive strength | Concrete mix design | Durability | Ecological effects | Green concrete | Life cycle assessment | Recycled aggregates | Residual products | Sewage sludge incineration ash,0,0,,,,undefined,

The design of new bridges involves the application of current aesthetic principles and the latest engineering tools to create a new structure. Bridge rehabilitation, on the other hand, takes the bridge as it is, warts and all, and tries to bring it back to health. The science of bridge rehabilitation includes load assessment and structural and member analysis. The art of bridge rehabilitation includes the condition assessment and the judgement needed to determine the most appropriate treatment required. Usually, the bridge rehabilitation engineer is faced with a number of options and a balance has to be reached between the extent and cost of repair work, and the estimated remaining life of the repaired structure. Rehabilitation engineers try to account for this by using fairly subjective, life cycle cost analysis techniques. Often, however rehabilitation decisions are based on factors other than engineering ones. Intuition, which Winston Churchill called 'logic in a hurry', and experience usually play a major role in the art of bridge rehabilitation. This paper describes a bridge rehabilitation project in the Canadian Prairies, where the extreme climate plays an important part in the design and construction of bridges. It outlines the engineering steps followed in assessing the strength of the bridge and the strengthening measures adopted. It shows how bridge rehabilitation engineers are constantly searching for new ways to meet the challenge of bridge care, and introduces the carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips as a method of deck strengthening.",Bridge girders | Carbon fiber polymer | Design | Flexure | Strength | Strips,1,0,,,,undefined,
